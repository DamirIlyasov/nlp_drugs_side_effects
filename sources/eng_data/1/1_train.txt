1	I hate how vyvanse makes me over think everything and it makes me angry about things that I shouldn't even be angry about
1	So I took a Adderall last night...I'm still awake.
1	Are you depressed? Are you anxious? Do you like headaches and diarrhea? If you answered yes to the last one, then Viibryd is right for you!
1	Lol viibryd made me puke first day taking it
1	21.36 day 9 Rivaroxaban diary. Particularly bad lower back ache had not eased by 14.00 so went to bed. Much better when I woke at 19.00.
1	why do I not remember going to bed or waking up (the answer: probably seroquel)
1	@NireBryce Thanks. There is a nonzero chance that the discomfort I am feeling was caused by going back on Cymbalta, possibly too quickly.
1	So, my Pregabalin was supposed to be being increased...but is now being decreased due to horrible dry eyes and mouth side effect. :(
1	Will still be on the Geodon, but will also be taking a low-dose alprazolam as needed for the sudden anxiety attacks ive been getting
1	Not to mention the thousands of people online who say they’ve stacked on the weight due to taking seroquel.
1	Adderall can actually keep me awake for days on end without an hour of sleep at all , and I hate that.
1	@abianne the Effexor may have been pushing me toward hypomania, so we are trying just an ssri, then see if a mood stabilizer is needed.
1	@CIPROisPOISON I'm in so much pain now... tendonitis, headaches, cognitive issues... I feel violated. #Cipro
1	@juppiecat1 @Heknowsmynam @stiNgo100 @Collmaxw @desertcronenm @ladyc10 Migh need to change it due to hallucinations.My mom took Restoril
1	@nanamack69 I'm here been in a seroquel coma lol
1	Day 3 without #venlafaxine. Worst drug ever to withdraw from? Any support much appreciated!
1	Hmm, interesting. I may have been undergoing Baclofen withdrawal hence the anxiety for the past few months… #hypochondria
1	can't sleep, but i'm afraid that the muscle tremors keep me awake even worse if i take promethazine in combination with fluoxetine...
1	My Philly dr prescribed me Trazodone,1pill made me so fkn sick, couldnt move 2day.Xtreme migraine, puke, shakes. Any1else get that react?
1	@Love__Nino @jesjosie my ex was on geodon and she had a seizure in the latrine at AIT. I would just fall asleep at metro stops, restaurants
1	@santypas @scrabalisios I'm taking 700mg pregablin and 60 mg duloxetine hence why I'm totally mashed
1	Have any of you developed knee pain since starting Tysabri ? What helps with the problem ?
1	Time to fail yet another final. Hopefully this mix of adderall and coffee in my system help lol
1	wish I could stay up and do nicething with all the loveliesd but woah does seroquel hit hard
1	I am still laughing. This is what weaning off of Paxil and being a moron does to you.
1	Took a line of adderall and cleaned my entire room AND color coordinated my clothes, I needed that haha
1	@MileyCyrus I am disabled-live in pain from Levaquin-some get better some do not. May 8 rally in Wash DC-plea rid of cipro avelox and lev
1	“@AdderallHadMe: Adderall had me winning an Olympic gold medal in multitasking” @amh4309 lol lol lol
1	one of the things i hate most about quetiapine is when i take it for the first few hours i slur my words, so people assume i'm merely drunk.
1	Just had a marathon sleep past 24hrs on new dose of #duloxetine -hope my liver will be ok on it.Woke with stressy tummy pains. #sideeffects
1	finals week tip: make sure u poop, pee, and eat tums before u take adderall to study; all of which will help u retain the drug in ur body
1	It's ok, yahoo answers is pretty much in consensus that expired oxycodone is OK. If anything it may be less effective so I should take MORE
1	Ok, if I'm going to test this (slightly) expired oxycodone then it stands to reason I should be at work when I do. #Adventure
1	Shew Lawd !!! This Tecfidera is gonna kill me!! Not really, but this flushing is very uncomfortable ! #MSsucks
1	Lamictal dosage increases kind of wreck my head for a day or two. But they also make me super productive as long as I can do things slowly.
1	Well,yesterday was rubbish(post humira)all day in bed,loads of pain etc.Just got up and I think I'm alright?Give it an hour and reassess lol
1	I wish adderall was available over the counter..first time I took son I drank a beer and cleaned the attic lol
1	If Mr Weren't here I'd take a little extra quetiapine and sleep all day. But he is here and I don't think he'll be on board with that :(
1	This Lyrica stuff just makes me want to eat and sleep! #fatkidprobs #hangry
1	Starting Humira tomorrow. :) I wonder if it will make me tired for a day or so like Remicade did. If it works, it's worth it.
1	Seriously considering taking a seroquel just so i can go to sleep omg
1	@stavvers Yeah I hear epilim is pretty tough, sorry to hear re bad times with it :( Oddly, dear sweet Lamotrigine tipped me to a dark place
1	@southkirk @PositiveAboutMS Thinking it might be the baclofen doing it.Only on a low dose though.Broken sleep is a nightmare.#MSFatigue
1	do i come off my medication or do i just continue to be a prozac zombie
1	Since Enbrel helped relive my joint pain , my hearings gone , I can't feel my legs ,have 3 eyes, an xtra kid ,but I can still play Golf .
1	Lamotrigine causing steven johnson syndrome
1	Seriously? The Royals are four wins from the World Series? I thought I had awakened from oxycodone in an alternate universe. ;-) @mikeleake
1	@anwen @Ellwynnnnn Venlafaxine withdrawal is worse than most by miles x
1	@stopthatimp geodon withdrawl is HELL.

1	@Fuqoffbruh @MommaWife76 I could totally go for some adderall right now I'd be finished in like 30min!

1	Rivaroxaban diary day 22. Am beginning to think all pains from pressure on that part of body are due to fluid retention.

1	Paxil withdrawal is nasty. Do not like.
1	@TheQuinnspiracy I spent a week in the hospital for sepsis, heroic doses of levaquin that made things taste funny for a month.

1	Pristiq and im livin in a cold world
1	@david82wilkins @CFAware Neither of you appear to be aware that Cipro can cripple otherwise healthy people...doctor fail to mention that?
1	@jesjosie LMAO. i loved geodon until i started passing out in public and losing chunks of my day. it was good when it was good, though.
1	@OkieVision @GeorgeZisaFatty @MigueleSantos1 no I care, Temazepam and Adderall are pretty strong drugs, cause paranoia amongst other things
1	So I may be allergic to the metoprolol. Rash on my face. Needing my inhaler daily since Friday.
1	@xMandyJayne Trazodone is what he gave me while ago. That shit had me all tore up. I didn't like that shit haha.

1	Well! That was icky. I think Lamictal and Lexapro do not get along when taken within 3 hours of each other.
1	I don't like taking Seroquel at night. Makes me crabby the whole time the following day. Something about feeling sluggish and groggy. Aargh.
1	@andresoprano Steady dose of meds, anti-inflams, pain killer and lots of water. Uloric is by far best but kills ur gut.
1	@smrtmnky @Isdcats Oh Christ, how could I forget that!? I can because of Neurontin Man quieting the nerves and whacking the memories.
1	Expired pregabalin = disturbing nightmares that youre not sure youve woken from...Although it could just be London.
1	Percocets adderall ecstasy pussy, money, weed faded for a week, I don't sleep fuck my enemies
1	My doctor told me to stop, he gave me something to pop. I mixed it up with some adderall and i wait to get to the top.
1	Adderall and Red bull, baby i'm the best so you can't do better! #Timeflies #FargoNDpic.twitter.com/toP3bKfIwX
1	great.. I have hives up and down my legs from this gosh dang trazodone
1	I took more quetiapine & zopiclone than needed. Not OD more than I needed but poor coping mechanism more than I needed. May add clonazepam.
1	I need adderall to get me through the rest of the semester
1	How much adderall would it take to kill a 195 lb human male? Asking for a friend
1	@_celticfool_ but first! Try these lovely pharmies! #zoloft <— can’t cum feel numb #paxil hate life more and everyone else ? 0_o
1	gonna need some adderall or some shit to get through tomorrow
1	I haven't taken an adderall in a while just doing HW but it's the best
1	Blowing dis gas wit darvon
1	Thankyou adderall and redbull for being the reason why I pass all my classes
1	@HarryDFish @deltrimental Joe is on Pristiq and he gets weird brain zap / twitch things too.
1	@dougcarter4 get well soon, sir. Levaquin did a number on my joints a few years back.
1	Today I'm an emotional mess. That's what happens when I think I could wean myself off of Cymbalta.
1	Still drunk just popped an adderall and now to school
1	I need to come up on some adderall for this final tomorrow
1	"@AdderalIHadMe: Adderall had me sending out novels for text messages." #everytime
1	This Lamictal shit ain't cuttin the mustard; any "mood stabilizers" that don't steal your soul & make u a bloated zombie a la Britney?
1	@hellavno @SpringerSaint @CorynRDR I took victoza and the sick feeling does ease and stop. I found taking in evening helped.
1	03.25 day 13 Rivaroxaban diary. Neck ache and right shoulder ache. Lower back pain.
1	Pah. Meh-ness + pregabalin drowsiness & dizziness is making me sloth-like. I've not been able to read a book for weeks. Not a good sign.
1	@KevyT615 yeah it's gonna be easy AF I just popped 3 adderall I'm super ready nothing can stop me
1	@HDAwareness cause UCD sayed I had Huntington's disease for like 8 yrs, then said high dose zyprexa caused a false diagnosis. I think I have
1	@maddoggiejo @mentalpolitical also told me I was imagining agitation from lyrica because she hasn't heard anyone say it.It's common effect
1	@NeelieB @DavidJuurlink @US_FDA hot flashes won't be around forever; but weaning of paroxetine could be a nightmare
1	Med update? 80mg of Latuda (which gives me the weirdest feeling an hour after taking it) & .5 mg of clonazepam. He won't give me more :(
1	If this test doesn't kill me, the heart attack from the mass amounts of adderall and caffeine in my system surely will.
1	@lil_mermaid NOT A COP AND WANT TO OBTAIN SOME MARIJUANA AND OXYCODONE FOR A REASONABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT PLEASE INSTRUCT
1	Oh and did I tell you I took 60mg of temazepam since I didn't fall asleep I'm high yay me
1	Not taking gabapentin tonight, see if I feel less zombie like tomorrow. Nothing is worth the brain cloud and lack of coordination.
1	"Take ludes for my back pain, adderall to keep me focused. xanax to take the edge off, weed to mellow me down and morphine cos it's awesome"
1	Fuck Paxil. I never want to take this shit again, but every time I try I get ridiculously sick. My life suckssss.
1	#tysabri really takes it out on me. Spent most of the day sleeping.
1	This girl goes "Im prescribed adderall but I don't take it cuz I don't like the sideeffects". Half the class is gonna hit her up after class
1	This quetiapine isn't working damnit!!!! Does make me hungry at night though... *sigh*
1	@MarkMcGahan80 does the Tysabri make you tired at first after infusion, not that you need an excuse to be tired! Sleep well xx :o) xx
1	@drrachael Since VIOXX killed my mother HIGHLY suggest persons who notice change in loved one, friend, anyone investigate adverse reactions.
1	Handful of Seroquel tonight. All I wanna do is sleep forever and a week.
1	Your humira shot burns with the power of a thousand suns #IBDFMLMoments #Crohns #IBD #UC
1	Effexor side effects; headaches, no appetite.
1	@RayyDePotter yeaa bihh all jacked up on vyvanse!
1	So, I lasted 16 days on Seroquel. I couldn't handle the awful side effects. Constantly dizzy and lightheadeded & a myriad of other bad stuff
1	That Seroquel has been given me some seriously fucked up dreams.
1	@yonniedepp I'm hip, but that's what my other tweet is about lol took too much adderall
1	08.15 day 13 Rivaroxaban diary. Lower back ache, neck ache, hips and knees ache, short of breath, (am asthmatic) taken 2paracetamol, to bed.
1	Oops I did'nt eat before taking the Gabapentin now I'm floating on the breeze...lol...Won't do that again...phhwahhh.
1	Hello, world! Quetiapine zombie this morning and I have a work call in about 45 minutes. Perfect combination.
1	@Sarahcollier20 @epilepsyaction was on keppra came off them as they stopped me feeling hungry and I lost to much weight I'm now on vimpat
1	@remiamaka It wasn't an easy victory though. Felt like chemo with the Cipro. As for the heart, i meant for study purposes.
1	Morning fluoxetine burp makes me want to ralph.
1	I really feel like this fluoxetine is messing with my perspective time and people.
1	Wow, so I don't think I've talked to my new step dad this much ever. I guess I should not sleep and do adderall more often
1	This new medication is kicking my ass. And I feel flushed. Hope I make it through the night. Restoril is not playing around
1	Apparently, Baclofen greatly exacerbates the "AD" part of my ADHD. Average length of focus today: about 30 seconds.
1	@BlogSazzles i was on keppra for awhile,i had terrible mood swings while i was on it.im on Vimpat now,and dehydration is a major thing.
1	This higher dose of #cymbalta is making me extremely tired and anxious. Is this normal?
1	A fellow RA'er wants to know if Humira causes weight gain?
1	took 5, maybe 10 minutes to go from "why isn't the seroquel working" to "what is a bed, i will just use my keyboard"
1	Oh hey. Much like other anti-convulsants, Lamictal dehydrates you. So much is explained.
1	snorted a line of oxycodone last night & swear i was feeling alllll types of waysss since i was on molly.♡
1	@Purpleviolin91 I haven't been diagnosed with pots but i do have orthostatic hypotension which they say is a side effect of namenda
1	So unfair, I never get the good side effects of meds. Ativan, Seroquel, & Ambien XR make me feel so drink I cant really walk & Im nauseated
1	The one bummer about it all is that the Fluoxetine is giving me the shakes which made fine fiddly detail work harder than it should be
1	@lavenderfuchsia I lost weight in the past but it was much easier. Like 2 steps forward, one step back on the quetiapine.
1	I have so much online homework due today, someone give me adderall
1	@MS_marathon Tired after the tysabri infusion? I am...
1	Of course Lance Armstrong was on drugs, you know how long he had to ride that bike? I take an adderall to clean my room
1	I know all you niggas go to school where's the adderall at?
1	@almostwell yeh same bk felt like sumo wrestler on it all time :( think its f****ed me 4life :( ironic as Humira is used to treat artheritis
1	Anybody have some ritalin or adderall I could use to study for this final? Lol.
1	Debating taking another Adderall so I can focus on my homework better but I already feel like barfing so idk if its a good idea
1	Only one day in and Mirtazapine is like fluoxetine all over again, it just makes me so tiered
1	Oh for fuck's sake. My mouth is bleeding again. Can't blame the Gabapentin this time. What the fuck???
1	@AaronM effexor was a boner killer, absolutely. welbutrin goes the other way.
1	I asked Vanessa if I could borrow a pair of pants and she hit me with that, "DO U GOT AN ADDERALL I CAN BORROW?"
1	@Glinda_R @SpooniesCouch Cymbalta withdrawal is getting top billing at the moment, however. Ugh! xx
1	Adderall & a few bong rips and its time for class.
1	Had a dream my eyes got burned out of my head. Thank you trazodone
1	@MCifm I have some spare Lexapro and Seroquel if you want any. They keep me from killing myself.
1	@guccigreenery i felt drugged on Ritalin. i love vyvanse. i can't tell i'm on it except for feeling better and calmer and more structured
1	Why do I always get the seroquel munchies!?
1	i can stay up later with less geodon and less zoloft but then i can't fall asleep and want to stay in bed all day. this has been my week
1	@mikedelic if this is a real question, withdrawal from an antidepressant named Effexor was worse than cocaine withdrawal
1	@ABittersweet1 Cipro destroyed my entire body, from head to toe. Bedridden since 2009. Be VERY careful.
1	Owww. I hurt my foot. & am concerned. 1st warning on Cipro is tendon damage. :-/ It certainly wasn't a rupture. I'm sure I'm just paranoid.
1	@TheEastMovie Thank you so much for getting the message out...wish I could see the film but Bayer CRIPPLED ME with Cipro back in 2009!
1	Does anyone happen to know if Lamictal causes you to feel hot? @liberonetwork @_Sabiiiiii #cantstopsweating
1	Rivaroxaban 2/2 lower back pain. Not very PC but am crippled by this drug. Taking more paracetamols. Must ring for 'phone consultation.
1	Tysabri infusion today at hospital. Extra shattered this time. Can't keep my eyes open. #fatigue @MSIRELAND @mssocietyuk
1	@MissMazyGG anxiety has been so high. But yeah, if your dosage is high its hard to come off. I had to detox from pristiq (its cousin drug)
1	Ok I've got a med ? Anyone ever tried cymbalta?? My doc put me on it but I slept 10 hrs straight!!
1	@Love__Nino @jesjosie i think geodon really changed my brain. that's crazy (re: wellbutrin). i'm considering going back but still more no
1	College must have been so much tougher back in the day without adderall and there was nothing but mids
1	i rilly want to get off cymbalta but i don't want to suffer through terrible withdrawals
1	That nap was on point.... Cymbalta did that shit cuz I dont take naps...ever
1	@jennyelliott88 FFS!! I'm getting shooting pains down arms & legs now & In eve whole body ache #humira is horrible
1	Me & Keisha really been debating on taking this Seroquel or not for like 20 mins lol
1	Awesome that my mom thinks I'm gonna be a bad influence on my sister now just bc i did adderall and got my nose pierced.
1	Neurontin helps my pain so much but basically puts me in a coma, of course. Can't win
1	Too tired to function right now, thanks Humira. #naptime
1	@jessicama20045 You know that Cipro is also made by Bayer, right? And it ALSO causes a horrific syndrome that mimics an auto-immune disease.
1	#KnowYourAnon I'm addicted to adderall and I've been trying to recover from it but I'm only able to little by little. For more info DM me
1	@INukeYou And then I had horrible sleep once I took the trazodone. I just couldn't win, haha.
1	I really hate the fact that I feel like I need to throw up while at work. Maybe taking my vyvanse wasn't a good idea
1	I firmly believe that every first time mom should be discharged from the hospital with samples of coffee and a prescription to adderall
1	#trazodone is one hell of a sleeping pill. it also makes you feel incredibly high.
1	idk if I'm shaking because I took adderall or if it's because I drank 2 red bulls within 20 minutes earlier
1	“@I_Am_Brendann: I'll be pretty bummed out if I don't take adderall once in my life” that's what I'm saying Adderall sounds fucking great
1	@LISABROWNPHOTOS Consider yourself lucky if all it does is make you dizzy and sick! Cipro crippled me and countless others.
1	@NMCC4 what meds are you on? Gabapentin /pregablin =horrible weight gain. Opiates can cause very bad nausea /stomach pains /vomiting...
1	On a related note: Tysabri causes weight gain. As does body pain/inability to exercise. Sigh. #fuckms
1	@Dani_DeeH Nope, I tested positive for JCV. JCV & Tysabri = permanent brain damage or sudden death.
1	@cloudtoad @MrsYisWhy @bigthink each brain is different. The SSRI I'm on has worked really well. Prozac made me a zombie. #Brains
