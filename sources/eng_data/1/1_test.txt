1	my nigga dante addicted to that nicotine
1	@quetiapineFella /swiftly taken off that for Vimpat. Vimpat made seizures less well controlled but less side effects. On that I had speech/
1	@libertymediapro 1st heart attack was from a blood clot likely caused by anti-inflammatory Vioxx taking for spinal probs. @michellemalkin
1	@dawn_hutton Totally understand Dawn would you like some of my oxycodone to go with the booze ,works a treat :)
1	People taking #quetiapine - does this need to sleep 24/7 go eventually? Cos this is not sustainable beyond the short term.
1	Fucking Effexor withdrawals. I would shake my fist but I don't have the energy.
1	@AnyssiaKaissa Depakote made me feel flat, but helps many. Zyprexa can cause weight gain, so be very careful. I can't tolerate it.
1	Oh, and I forgot that with Lamotrigine come awful night terrors. I woke up no fewer than five times screaming and sweaty. #lol
1	I need to progress onto oxazepam.Apparently it's more sedating. Seroquel is sedating, but you can hardly open or close your mouth.
1	Levaquin sucks. Blinding headaches. Vomiting. Diarrhea. Time for my next dose. Happy weekend. #tmi #FML
1	Mom just reminded me that I have OxyCodone to make me trip :-)))
1	@FrancieML fibro flares floor me so I can empathise with you on that. Doc put me on Lyrica 18mths ago n iv put 5st on n lost my memory.
1	@thebeachynurse ...had to get an x-ray of my arm per protocol...it was negative but it's just now starting to hurt. Ugh!!!! #Geodon
1	Weed x Codein x Oxycodone x Ecstasy x Alcohol x Hookah
1	I take Quaaludes 10-15 times a day for my "back pain", Adderall to stay focused, Xanax to take the edge off, pot to mellow me out.
1	Anyone who will listen: never ever take Effexor/Venlafaxine. Paraesthesia abound.
1	Taking my adderall at 2 in the afternoon was not one of my best decisions. #wired
1	@ElectroSocket I was on enbrel for 8 years have since developed neuro problems (ataxia) wish id never taken it side effects not worth risks
1	Take first Pristiq tablet for weeks. Immediately feel sick. :( #pleasebeworthit
1	@Showbizmom48 MRI showed lesions in my noggin :S Got to have EEG to see if its MS or Humira doing it.So more tests n messing about lolxx
1	@Butterflywgs ...my old ones! Plus caffeine in the morning counteracts these quite nicely whereas quetiapine hangovers were unshiftable
1	I'm sitting in this irrigation class Rollin balls on adderall and I pounded a monster. These dudes gotta think I'm cracked out
1	@Gildy55 TY, its nasty. They bleed for ages bcoz I'm on Rivaroxaban which is like mega warfarin so don't clot easy. Then they ooze 'stuff'!!
1	vyvanse makes me think too much
1	The cymbalta certainly is addictive & its FDA approved...
1	Rivaroxaban is great, until your patient gets a wound and bleeds solidly for 14hours from it!
1	Woke up with my januvia flu symptoms. Managed to plan out homeschool for the summer but that is about it for today. Suddenly it is 5.
1	jeremy gave me an adderall tho so we'll see how this goes pray 4 me
1	@sianmorgan Desvenlafaxine makes you lose weight though because you can't eat ANYTHING on it, it's killer. But it's been keeping me saner.
1	Gonna have to pop some adderall to get through tomorrow bc up too late !
1	I feel like Costco is to suburban moms as adderall is to UES moms.
1	Sleeping my life away on #quetiapine. Fine by me.
1	I've taken everything but my Trazodone that's tonight, but the nasal spray is giving me a drip :|
1	A mixture of Diazepam and Temazepam to make myself sleep was maybe not the greatest idea. I feel like the whole world is spinning around me.
1	#EdwardCovongton says the cocaine and seroquel "made me do this, it's not me. Lisa loved me" he is beginning to get emotional
1	NEW LAUNCH ITEM! SKY now offers Quetiapine Fumarate 100ct tablets in 100mg, 200mg, and 300mg strengths. Place your order now!
1	if you don't hear from me for awhile it's bc my mom just walked in on me snorting adderall with a boy
1	Effexor really should be illegal. I switched to Pristiq to try to get off of it, now stopped Pristiq, brain zaps back. Fury.
1	I knew one day enbrel would b the death of me
1	Still tripping that the "pharmacist" told me 45 bucks for a pill of adderall
1	I gave Zach 2 adderall and he just cleaned all of his shoes.
1	Took Adderall so I can get my homework done and ended up falling asleep fat as fuck
1	@dougbremner I wish I'd have found your article sooner! I was crippled by Cipro in Oct of '09. Prescribed for a UTI & it didn't even help.
1	welll..decided to get off paxil. withdrawals are killlerrr, like loss of circulation randomly in areas.
1	Brb licking the bottom of this altoid tin for crumbs of adderall leftover from coachella...
1	Woo it's so awesome when my Adderall makes me have a rapid heart rate when I run so I look like I'm about to have a heart attack
1	Please be careful when withdrawing from any anti deps, benzos and/or hypnotics. Venlafaxine was a bad choice for me and worse withdrawl.
1	@sianmorgan Oh a bit better! And a bit worse :/ Desvenlafaxine is working for me but the mouth and stomach ulcers aren't very nice.
1	Latuda side effects,not only don't want it for ♡ ones but, don't want 2 hang out with anyone on it.Side effect warnings r like scary movie.
1	@ctr1945 my mom used Rivaroxaban and it gave her a terrible time with weakness and muscle pain.
1	LOL at my sister trying to convince me to do adderall this morning
1	FOUND THEM. Starting back up on Effexor. Vomits shall ensue!
1	@wickychoo @LollyGee OMG ALL THE SPECIAL PLACES. I'm not drunk. It's the fluoxetine.
1	So much shit to do today and so much homework. adderall for sure today
1	@Shellyfanelly I was on #azathioprine for about 8 years, it worked well, now on #Humira instead though which is knocking me about
1	Trying to figure out an AP physics problem while on adderall is an adventure
1	@dsmpowered tolerance is built up super fast with them so people search for a stronger high. I took 5 Oxycodone at one time to feel it.
1	06.30 day 14 Rivaroxaban diary. Thanks to paracetamol and hot water bottle I had 4 hrs continuous sleep. Woke uo with frontal headache, 1/2
1	@dsymons @trainingwithra I agree that the after sting is much worse from #humira than #enbrel #rheum
1	I really need someone to fund my adderall habit because I'm broke and REALLY need some haha
1	This increase in Pregabalin (on Fri) is making me so tired and a wee bit dizzy but anxiety is calmer when I feel like this :S
1	Took an adderall to clean my room and ended up putting hundreds of mini glow in the dark stars on my ceiling insteadpic.twitter.com/5zaPOLYnOq
1	@thebeecharmer97 @deadfanclub I would NOT recommend toying around with Cipro if you don't have to. Did you know it can cripple you for life?
1	@Enlightenmentor Umm, are you being a smart-ass? Dont mess with me right now. Going through Cymbalta withdrawal I think & Im VERY depressed.
1	I try to be sexy, sad or quiet. So I'm ranting about how the antibiotic Levaquin has caused me permanent nerve damage over @FightBigPharma
1	Functioning when on Pregabalin is next to impossible #zombie
1	narcotic, benzo, etc rx's arent the only meds addictive. if i miss a dose of wellbutrin or effexor, my hands shake crazy & i get brain zaps
1	So while I'm letting the thoughts of Lamictal/fatal rashes/tonsillectomy/spinal tap settle, I'm going to go rescue a budgie.
1	@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand Lexapro gave me the worst mixed episodes. I have some instability with Pristiq but I can manage it ok.
1	@SQLSnark @sqlcheesecake @nineball Oxycodone is oxycodone, whoever gives it. Unless you get morphine, nothing beats oxycodone.
1	@AClassyStoner_ I'd take some oxycodone before that. I need a high that will last.
1	13.08 Day 13 Rivaroxaban diary. Pracetamol has taken away most of the aches, but still have lower back ache and weak knees.
1	@GoodWoodBush12 I have some Oxycodone pills buy em that's the closest your getting
1	(cont'd) My pdoc altered the dosage of @Fluoxetine to 30mg. That's the only alteration. Because I complained about the extreme fatigue. :-(

1	it's 6 am and still no sleep fuck you vyvanse
1	@jessindia I take fluoxetine and quetiapine. The quetiapine is the one with the massive sleepies, althouth the flouxetine doesn''t help.
1	if i put my head down in class and my profs yell at me i'm just gonna scream about how much i dislike viibryd so far
1	Uhh my gabapentin dose went up today and I don't even know what planet I'm on. I hope I adjust to this quickly ... #endometriosis

1	@AgentMariaHill I've taken the BP daily if not twice a day like I should, it's juz I didn't think the Effexor would spike it so. I'm usually
1	@zacsquiggles The Levaquin is very strong. Not too many side effects for dad. It just takes away all his strength.
1	@MerePrototype Probably the combination with my fluoxetine. But I can't move that to night time, it makes me have bad dreams.
1	@Iamjoy1 yeah I know, I dont take my trazadone at night cause it makes me feel groggy in the morning and I wont wake to my alarm):
1	My body already hates me for the copious amounts of adderall and lack of sleep and food it's about to endure these next few days
1	@SesshaBatto I was prescribed Levaquin w/ Prednisone 3X in 7 mos. Permanent nerve &tendon damage. There are hundreds of thousands of us.
1	I wonder if olanzapine causes restless legs <_<
1	@ItsMeCreezy I hate to hear that. Taking seroquel is like swallowing a sleeping pill when u wake up then trying to function normally
1	Vimpat makes me exhaugsted!!
1	My mom just asked my grandpa if he had ibuprofen and he replies "no but I got oxycodone and I'm addicted to them and they're great"
1	I guess the Doctor was right when he said don't eat any dairy products within 2 hours of taking this Levofloxacin. #almostanaccident 3 times
1	Well. I abruptly stopped taking Lamotrigine (Lamictal), and that is why I am having the pain and weakness. Possible seizure. Oops.
1	I'm surprised more players don't get busted for amphetamines. College folks pop adderall like candy to focus, so you know MLB guys do, too.
1	this nigga just told me he took Adderall to stay up to PLAY FUCKIN WOW OMFG
1	The Seroquel the doc gave me, makes doing things difficult. . . But if I don't do something, I'll fall asleep. The catch-22 of crazy.
1	Cause it's legal cocaine RT @NY_Wiseass: Why? Lol RT @Saint_Cellus: I really want to do Adderall again
1	I got some oxycodone who tryna buy it off me? $6 a pill
1	I was going to work the legs some today, but Viibryd gave me the Shits. Sooo it's best to avoid that for now.
1	08.26 day 14 rivaroxaban diary. Just been to cut some wild roses down so workmen can easily get to part of my garage. Intense back pain.
1	I think this Olanzapine makes me crazier.
1	@thebookgirl985 Trazodone makes me HUNGRY. Prop my eyelids open with toothpicks and drive me to a buffet?
1	Kinda worried about the nighttime jaw clenching from Effexor, what with my tongue ring and all... :L
1	@drugsalad for adderall or norcos? Either way why haven't you given me the hookup before? Hate chu
1	I have got to stop taking my Vyvanse so late!! #nosleep #addproblems
1	Whiskey and scotch . That's all I need..... Well maybe some oxycodone and cocaine too
1	How anyone can say there is no withdrawal from prozac withdrawal is beyond me. Their answer is to go back on it and up the dose.
1	Venlafaxine hangover finally starting to shift after 2 huge mugs of hot water with giant pieces of lemon...
1	Has anyone tried the humira shot, I heard it feels like hot lava going thru your skin for the first seconds but my doctor wants me to get it

1	my mom just threw away her Oxycodone from when she was sick, but now it's mine.
1	I have been on Seroquel (Quetiapine) for so long I don't even know what the side-effects are! Although, I think overheating is definitely 1.
1	Magically my appetite has gone back to normal since going off seroquel! Well, well, well - I was right, the doctor was wrong.
1	Pretty sure your three cups of coffee means adderall
1	Listens to Oxymoron once. “@HeyltsJ: they gave me oxycodone for the pain but i basically take them because they make me feel good ”
1	@KevinEC13 see I love oxycodone but roxis don't keep me high for very long, I gotta keep eating them hoes to stay high.. I like OP80s mmmm

1	Not winking at you Mr. Barista, I just way overdid it with the espresso shots & adderall today

1	@rioxide I'm sure if I went full time and stocked up on adderall I could be dmg in a year but that's only if I slept/playedsgo/repeat
1	i had the two humira shots today and the needle didnt hurt at all but the mEDICINE INSIDE BURNED LIKE LAVA
1	Gotta find an alternative to Vyvanse, ASAP. I'd rather be sleepy & happy, than alert & depressed!
1	I cant imagine how people got through college without adderall
1	The dishes keep piling up in my sink. Can I have an Adderall script?
1	Took some expired adderall this afternoon but didn't end up going out. Wide awake for nothing. Cool.

1	So apparently 60mgs of Prozac will make you scared of eating GMO's and make you think you need to save the world! Switching back to 40mgs!!!
1	Wish it was Monday...seeing doctor tomorrow & want to see if he has any suggestions for my withdrawal. #paroxetine #anxiety #fedup
1	This white lady asked me if we had oxycodone 30 I said no she was like are you lieing. BITCH YOU GUESSED IT
1	Plus this antibiotic is making me stupid and clumsy. Cipro is evil but the fever is gone.
1	@sapphire20 to it, and now I'm on Humira with just the bloat to battle. Things sometimes get super shitty in every sense. But stay strong xx
1	Bedtime. Hopefully the headache and nausea from the Levaquin will be gone leaving me with only the more common side effects of antibiotics.
1	So this time of night I can choose Lyrica (beware swollen throat, colon, penis, et. al.) or Adam and Eve. Same result.
