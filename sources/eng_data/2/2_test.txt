1	I ate 2 cakes + 2 pastries at work today. Blaming the quetiapine rather than my liking for cakes. Blaming work too for providing free cake.
1	my mom gave me a caffeine pill and i think it's actually adderall
1	Well! That was icky. I think Lamictal and Lexapro do not get along when taken within 3 hours of each other.
1	I don't like taking Seroquel at night. Makes me crabby the whole time the following day. Something about feeling sluggish and groggy. Aargh.
1	@andresoprano Steady dose of meds, anti-inflams, pain killer and lots of water. Uloric is by far best but kills ur gut.
1	@smrtmnky @Isdcats Oh Christ, how could I forget that!? I can because of Neurontin Man quieting the nerves and whacking the memories.

1	Med update? 80mg of Latuda (which gives me the weirdest feeling an hour after taking it) & .5 mg of clonazepam. He won't give me more :(
1	If this test doesn't kill me, the heart attack from the mass amounts of adderall and caffeine in my system surely will.
1	@lil_mermaid NOT A COP AND WANT TO OBTAIN SOME MARIJUANA AND OXYCODONE FOR A REASONABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT PLEASE INSTRUCT
1	Oh and did I tell you I took 60mg of temazepam since I didn't fall asleep I'm high yay me

1	#tysabri really takes it out on me. Spent most of the day sleeping.
1	This girl goes "Im prescribed adderall but I don't take it cuz I don't like the sideeffects". Half the class is gonna hit her up after class

1	@MarkMcGahan80 does the Tysabri make you tired at first after infusion, not that you need an excuse to be tired! Sleep well xx :o) xx
1	@drrachael Since VIOXX killed my mother HIGHLY suggest persons who notice change in loved one, friend, anyone investigate adverse reactions.
1	Handful of Seroquel tonight. All I wanna do is sleep forever and a week.
1	Your humira shot burns with the power of a thousand suns #IBDFMLMoments #Crohns #IBD #UC
1	Effexor side effects; headaches, no appetite.
1	@RayyDePotter yeaa bihh all jacked up on vyvanse!
1	So, I lasted 16 days on Seroquel. I couldn't handle the awful side effects. Constantly dizzy and lightheadeded & a myriad of other bad stuff
1	That Seroquel has been given me some seriously fucked up dreams.
1	@yonniedepp I'm hip, but that's what my other tweet is about lol took too much adderall

1	@Sarahcollier20 @epilepsyaction was on keppra came off them as they stopped me feeling hungry and I lost to much weight I'm now on vimpat
1	@remiamaka It wasn't an easy victory though. Felt like chemo with the Cipro. As for the heart, i meant for study purposes.
1	Morning fluoxetine burp makes me want to ralph.
1	I really feel like this fluoxetine is messing with my perspective time and people.
1	Wow, so I don't think I've talked to my new step dad this much ever. I guess I should not sleep and do adderall more often
1	This new medication is kicking my ass. And I feel flushed. Hope I make it through the night. Restoril is not playing around
1	Apparently, Baclofen greatly exacerbates the "AD" part of my ADHD. Average length of focus today: about 30 seconds.
1	@BlogSazzles i was on keppra for awhile,i had terrible mood swings while i was on it.im on Vimpat now,and dehydration is a major thing.
1	This higher dose of #cymbalta is making me extremely tired and anxious. Is this normal?
1	A fellow RA'er wants to know if Humira causes weight gain?
1	took 5, maybe 10 minutes to go from "why isn't the seroquel working" to "what is a bed, i will just use my keyboard"
1	Oh hey. Much like other anti-convulsants, Lamictal dehydrates you. So much is explained.
1	snorted a line of oxycodone last night & swear i was feeling alllll types of waysss since i was on molly.♡
1	@Purpleviolin91 I haven't been diagnosed with pots but i do have orthostatic hypotension which they say is a side effect of namenda
1	So unfair, I never get the good side effects of meds. Ativan, Seroquel, & Ambien XR make me feel so drink I cant really walk & Im nauseated
1	The one bummer about it all is that the Fluoxetine is giving me the shakes which made fine fiddly detail work harder than it should be
1	@lavenderfuchsia I lost weight in the past but it was much easier. Like 2 steps forward, one step back on the quetiapine.
1	I have so much online homework due today, someone give me adderall

1	Oh for fuck's sake. My mouth is bleeding again. Can't blame the Gabapentin this time. What the fuck???
1	@AaronM effexor was a boner killer, absolutely. welbutrin goes the other way.
1	I asked Vanessa if I could borrow a pair of pants and she hit me with that, "DO U GOT AN ADDERALL I CAN BORROW?"
1	@Glinda_R @SpooniesCouch Cymbalta withdrawal is getting top billing at the moment, however. Ugh! xx
1	Adderall & a few bong rips and its time for class.
1	Had a dream my eyes got burned out of my head. Thank you trazodone
1	@MCifm I have some spare Lexapro and Seroquel if you want any. They keep me from killing myself.
1	@guccigreenery i felt drugged on Ritalin. i love vyvanse. i can't tell i'm on it except for feeling better and calmer and more structured
1	Why do I always get the seroquel munchies!?
1	i can stay up later with less geodon and less zoloft but then i can't fall asleep and want to stay in bed all day. this has been my week
1	@mikedelic if this is a real question, withdrawal from an antidepressant named Effexor was worse than cocaine withdrawal
1	@ABittersweet1 Cipro destroyed my entire body, from head to toe. Bedridden since 2009. Be VERY careful.
1	Owww. I hurt my foot. & am concerned. 1st warning on Cipro is tendon damage. :-/ It certainly wasn't a rupture. I'm sure I'm just paranoid.
1	@TheEastMovie Thank you so much for getting the message out...wish I could see the film but Bayer CRIPPLED ME with Cipro back in 2009!
1	Does anyone happen to know if Lamictal causes you to feel hot? @liberonetwork @_Sabiiiiii #cantstopsweating

1	Tysabri infusion today at hospital. Extra shattered this time. Can't keep my eyes open. #fatigue @MSIRELAND @mssocietyuk
1	@MissMazyGG anxiety has been so high. But yeah, if your dosage is high its hard to come off. I had to detox from pristiq (its cousin drug)
1	Ok I've got a med ? Anyone ever tried cymbalta?? My doc put me on it but I slept 10 hrs straight!!
1	@Love__Nino @jesjosie i think geodon really changed my brain. that's crazy (re: wellbutrin). i'm considering going back but still more no
1	College must have been so much tougher back in the day without adderall and there was nothing but mids

1	Me & Keisha really been debating on taking this Seroquel or not for like 20 mins lol
1	Awesome that my mom thinks I'm gonna be a bad influence on my sister now just bc i did adderall and got my nose pierced.
1	Neurontin helps my pain so much but basically puts me in a coma, of course. Can't win
1	Too tired to function right now, thanks Humira. #naptime
1	@jessicama20045 You know that Cipro is also made by Bayer, right? And it ALSO causes a horrific syndrome that mimics an auto-immune disease.
1	#KnowYourAnon I'm addicted to adderall and I've been trying to recover from it but I'm only able to little by little. For more info DM me
1	@INukeYou And then I had horrible sleep once I took the trazodone. I just couldn't win, haha.
1	I really hate the fact that I feel like I need to throw up while at work. Maybe taking my vyvanse wasn't a good idea
1	I firmly believe that every first time mom should be discharged from the hospital with samples of coffee and a prescription to adderall
1	#trazodone is one hell of a sleeping pill. it also makes you feel incredibly high.
1	idk if I'm shaking because I took adderall or if it's because I drank 2 red bulls within 20 minutes earlier
1	“@I_Am_Brendann: I'll be pretty bummed out if I don't take adderall once in my life” that's what I'm saying Adderall sounds fucking great
1	@LISABROWNPHOTOS Consider yourself lucky if all it does is make you dizzy and sick! Cipro crippled me and countless others.
1	@NMCC4 what meds are you on? Gabapentin /pregablin =horrible weight gain. Opiates can cause very bad nausea /stomach pains /vomiting...
1	On a related note: Tysabri causes weight gain. As does body pain/inability to exercise. Sigh. #fuckms
1	@Dani_DeeH Nope, I tested positive for JCV. JCV & Tysabri = permanent brain damage or sudden death.
1	@cloudtoad @MrsYisWhy @bigthink each brain is different. The SSRI I'm on has worked really well. Prozac made me a zombie. #Brains
