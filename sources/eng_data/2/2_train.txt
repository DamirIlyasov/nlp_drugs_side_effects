1	I hate how vyvanse makes me over think everything and it makes me angry about things that I shouldn't even be angry about
1	So I took a Adderall last night...I'm still awake.
1	Are you depressed? Are you anxious? Do you like headaches and diarrhea? If you answered yes to the last one, then Viibryd is right for you!
1	Lol viibryd made me puke first day taking it
1	21.36 day 9 Rivaroxaban diary. Particularly bad lower back ache had not eased by 14.00 so went to bed. Much better when I woke at 19.00.
1	why do I not remember going to bed or waking up (the answer: probably seroquel)
1	@NireBryce Thanks. There is a nonzero chance that the discomfort I am feeling was caused by going back on Cymbalta, possibly too quickly.
1	So, my Pregabalin was supposed to be being increased...but is now being decreased due to horrible dry eyes and mouth side effect. :(
1	Will still be on the Geodon, but will also be taking a low-dose alprazolam as needed for the sudden anxiety attacks ive been getting
1	Not to mention the thousands of people online who say they’ve stacked on the weight due to taking seroquel.
1	Adderall can actually keep me awake for days on end without an hour of sleep at all , and I hate that.
1	@abianne the Effexor may have been pushing me toward hypomania, so we are trying just an ssri, then see if a mood stabilizer is needed.
1	@CIPROisPOISON I'm in so much pain now... tendonitis, headaches, cognitive issues... I feel violated. #Cipro
1	@juppiecat1 @Heknowsmynam @stiNgo100 @Collmaxw @desertcronenm @ladyc10 Migh need to change it due to hallucinations.My mom took Restoril
1	@nanamack69 I'm here been in a seroquel coma lol
1	Day 3 without #venlafaxine. Worst drug ever to withdraw from? Any support much appreciated!
1	Hmm, interesting. I may have been undergoing Baclofen withdrawal hence the anxiety for the past few months… #hypochondria
1	can't sleep, but i'm afraid that the muscle tremors keep me awake even worse if i take promethazine in combination with fluoxetine...
1	My Philly dr prescribed me Trazodone,1pill made me so fkn sick, couldnt move 2day.Xtreme migraine, puke, shakes. Any1else get that react?
1	@Love__Nino @jesjosie my ex was on geodon and she had a seizure in the latrine at AIT. I would just fall asleep at metro stops, restaurants
1	@santypas @scrabalisios I'm taking 700mg pregablin and 60 mg duloxetine hence why I'm totally mashed
1	Have any of you developed knee pain since starting Tysabri ? What helps with the problem ?
1	Time to fail yet another final. Hopefully this mix of adderall and coffee in my system help lol
1	wish I could stay up and do nicething with all the loveliesd but woah does seroquel hit hard
1	I am still laughing. This is what weaning off of Paxil and being a moron does to you.
1	Took a line of adderall and cleaned my entire room AND color coordinated my clothes, I needed that haha
1	@MileyCyrus I am disabled-live in pain from Levaquin-some get better some do not. May 8 rally in Wash DC-plea rid of cipro avelox and lev
1	“@AdderallHadMe: Adderall had me winning an Olympic gold medal in multitasking” @amh4309 lol lol lol
1	one of the things i hate most about quetiapine is when i take it for the first few hours i slur my words, so people assume i'm merely drunk.
1	Just had a marathon sleep past 24hrs on new dose of #duloxetine -hope my liver will be ok on it.Woke with stressy tummy pains. #sideeffects
1	finals week tip: make sure u poop, pee, and eat tums before u take adderall to study; all of which will help u retain the drug in ur body
1	It's ok, yahoo answers is pretty much in consensus that expired oxycodone is OK. If anything it may be less effective so I should take MORE
1	Ok, if I'm going to test this (slightly) expired oxycodone then it stands to reason I should be at work when I do. #Adventure
1	Shew Lawd !!! This Tecfidera is gonna kill me!! Not really, but this flushing is very uncomfortable ! #MSsucks
1	Lamictal dosage increases kind of wreck my head for a day or two. But they also make me super productive as long as I can do things slowly.
1	Well,yesterday was rubbish(post humira)all day in bed,loads of pain etc.Just got up and I think I'm alright?Give it an hour and reassess lol
1	I wish adderall was available over the counter..first time I took son I drank a beer and cleaned the attic lol
1	If Mr Weren't here I'd take a little extra quetiapine and sleep all day. But he is here and I don't think he'll be on board with that :(
1	This Lyrica stuff just makes me want to eat and sleep! #fatkidprobs #hangry
1	Starting Humira tomorrow. :) I wonder if it will make me tired for a day or so like Remicade did. If it works, it's worth it.
1	Seriously considering taking a seroquel just so i can go to sleep omg
1	@stavvers Yeah I hear epilim is pretty tough, sorry to hear re bad times with it :( Oddly, dear sweet Lamotrigine tipped me to a dark place
1	@southkirk @PositiveAboutMS Thinking it might be the baclofen doing it.Only on a low dose though.Broken sleep is a nightmare.#MSFatigue
1	do i come off my medication or do i just continue to be a prozac zombie
1	Since Enbrel helped relive my joint pain , my hearings gone , I can't feel my legs ,have 3 eyes, an xtra kid ,but I can still play Golf .
1	Lamotrigine causing steven johnson syndrome
1	Seriously? The Royals are four wins from the World Series? I thought I had awakened from oxycodone in an alternate universe. ;-) @mikeleake
1	@anwen @Ellwynnnnn Venlafaxine withdrawal is worse than most by miles x
1	@stopthatimp geodon withdrawl is HELL.

1	@Fuqoffbruh @MommaWife76 I could totally go for some adderall right now I'd be finished in like 30min!

1	Rivaroxaban diary day 22. Am beginning to think all pains from pressure on that part of body are due to fluid retention.

1	Paxil withdrawal is nasty. Do not like.
1	@TheQuinnspiracy I spent a week in the hospital for sepsis, heroic doses of levaquin that made things taste funny for a month.

1	Pristiq and im livin in a cold world
1	@david82wilkins @CFAware Neither of you appear to be aware that Cipro can cripple otherwise healthy people...doctor fail to mention that?
1	@jesjosie LMAO. i loved geodon until i started passing out in public and losing chunks of my day. it was good when it was good, though.
1	@OkieVision @GeorgeZisaFatty @MigueleSantos1 no I care, Temazepam and Adderall are pretty strong drugs, cause paranoia amongst other things
1	So I may be allergic to the metoprolol. Rash on my face. Needing my inhaler daily since Friday.
1	@xMandyJayne Trazodone is what he gave me while ago. That shit had me all tore up. I didn't like that shit haha.

1	Brb licking the bottom of this altoid tin for crumbs of adderall leftover from coachella...
1	Woo it's so awesome when my Adderall makes me have a rapid heart rate when I run so I look like I'm about to have a heart attack
1	Please be careful when withdrawing from any anti deps, benzos and/or hypnotics. Venlafaxine was a bad choice for me and worse withdrawl.
1	@sianmorgan Oh a bit better! And a bit worse :/ Desvenlafaxine is working for me but the mouth and stomach ulcers aren't very nice.
1	Latuda side effects,not only don't want it for ♡ ones but, don't want 2 hang out with anyone on it.Side effect warnings r like scary movie.

1	@Enlightenmentor Umm, are you being a smart-ass? Dont mess with me right now. Going through Cymbalta withdrawal I think & Im VERY depressed.
1	I try to be sexy, sad or quiet. So I'm ranting about how the antibiotic Levaquin has caused me permanent nerve damage over @FightBigPharma
1	Functioning when on Pregabalin is next to impossible #zombie
1	narcotic, benzo, etc rx's arent the only meds addictive. if i miss a dose of wellbutrin or effexor, my hands shake crazy & i get brain zaps
1	So while I'm letting the thoughts of Lamictal/fatal rashes/tonsillectomy/spinal tap settle, I'm going to go rescue a budgie.
1	@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand Lexapro gave me the worst mixed episodes. I have some instability with Pristiq but I can manage it ok.
1	@SQLSnark @sqlcheesecake @nineball Oxycodone is oxycodone, whoever gives it. Unless you get morphine, nothing beats oxycodone.

1	@AgentMariaHill I've taken the BP daily if not twice a day like I should, it's juz I didn't think the Effexor would spike it so. I'm usually
1	@zacsquiggles The Levaquin is very strong. Not too many side effects for dad. It just takes away all his strength.
1	@MerePrototype Probably the combination with my fluoxetine. But I can't move that to night time, it makes me have bad dreams.
1	@Iamjoy1 yeah I know, I dont take my trazadone at night cause it makes me feel groggy in the morning and I wont wake to my alarm):
1	My body already hates me for the copious amounts of adderall and lack of sleep and food it's about to endure these next few days
1	@SesshaBatto I was prescribed Levaquin w/ Prednisone 3X in 7 mos. Permanent nerve &tendon damage. There are hundreds of thousands of us.
1	I wonder if olanzapine causes restless legs <_<

1	Well. I abruptly stopped taking Lamotrigine (Lamictal), and that is why I am having the pain and weakness. Possible seizure. Oops.

1	this nigga just told me he took Adderall to stay up to PLAY FUCKIN WOW OMFG
1	The Seroquel the doc gave me, makes doing things difficult. . . But if I don't do something, I'll fall asleep. The catch-22 of crazy.

1	08.26 day 14 rivaroxaban diary. Just been to cut some wild roses down so workmen can easily get to part of my garage. Intense back pain.
1	I think this Olanzapine makes me crazier.
1	@thebookgirl985 Trazodone makes me HUNGRY. Prop my eyelids open with toothpicks and drive me to a buffet?
1	Kinda worried about the nighttime jaw clenching from Effexor, what with my tongue ring and all... :L
1	@drugsalad for adderall or norcos? Either way why haven't you given me the hookup before? Hate chu
1	I have got to stop taking my Vyvanse so late!! #nosleep #addproblems
1	Whiskey and scotch . That's all I need..... Well maybe some oxycodone and cocaine too

1	Magically my appetite has gone back to normal since going off seroquel! Well, well, well - I was right, the doctor was wrong.
1	Pretty sure your three cups of coffee means adderall
1	Listens to Oxymoron once. “@HeyltsJ: they gave me oxycodone for the pain but i basically take them because they make me feel good ”

1	I cant imagine how people got through college without adderall
1	The dishes keep piling up in my sink. Can I have an Adderall script?
