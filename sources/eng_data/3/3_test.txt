1	@shinobi_brian hugs I have been put on gabapentin and it is giving me migranes
1	@JenniferannHatc I understand Bystolic does mess with losing weight, but I've still slowly pulled it off. The PTU is a new challenge now.

1	@disabledmedic Quetiapine perhaps gives most dramatic effect for single low dose. No, pts are not being lazy in bed 20 hours a day, asleep!
