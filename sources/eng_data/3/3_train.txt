1	I hate how vyvanse makes me over think everything and it makes me angry about things that I shouldn't even be angry about
1	So I took a Adderall last night...I'm still awake.
1	Are you depressed? Are you anxious? Do you like headaches and diarrhea? If you answered yes to the last one, then Viibryd is right for you!
1	Lol viibryd made me puke first day taking it
1	21.36 day 9 Rivaroxaban diary. Particularly bad lower back ache had not eased by 14.00 so went to bed. Much better when I woke at 19.00.
1	why do I not remember going to bed or waking up (the answer: probably seroquel)
1	@NireBryce Thanks. There is a nonzero chance that the discomfort I am feeling was caused by going back on Cymbalta, possibly too quickly.
1	So, my Pregabalin was supposed to be being increased...but is now being decreased due to horrible dry eyes and mouth side effect. :(
1	Will still be on the Geodon, but will also be taking a low-dose alprazolam as needed for the sudden anxiety attacks ive been getting
1	Not to mention the thousands of people online who say they’ve stacked on the weight due to taking seroquel.
1	Adderall can actually keep me awake for days on end without an hour of sleep at all , and I hate that.
1	@abianne the Effexor may have been pushing me toward hypomania, so we are trying just an ssri, then see if a mood stabilizer is needed.
1	@CIPROisPOISON I'm in so much pain now... tendonitis, headaches, cognitive issues... I feel violated. #Cipro
1	@juppiecat1 @Heknowsmynam @stiNgo100 @Collmaxw @desertcronenm @ladyc10 Migh need to change it due to hallucinations.My mom took Restoril
1	@nanamack69 I'm here been in a seroquel coma lol
1	Day 3 without #venlafaxine. Worst drug ever to withdraw from? Any support much appreciated!
1	Hmm, interesting. I may have been undergoing Baclofen withdrawal hence the anxiety for the past few months… #hypochondria
1	can't sleep, but i'm afraid that the muscle tremors keep me awake even worse if i take promethazine in combination with fluoxetine...
1	My Philly dr prescribed me Trazodone,1pill made me so fkn sick, couldnt move 2day.Xtreme migraine, puke, shakes. Any1else get that react?

1	“@AdderallHadMe: Adderall had me winning an Olympic gold medal in multitasking” @amh4309 lol lol lol

1	Just had a marathon sleep past 24hrs on new dose of #duloxetine -hope my liver will be ok on it.Woke with stressy tummy pains. #sideeffects
1	finals week tip: make sure u poop, pee, and eat tums before u take adderall to study; all of which will help u retain the drug in ur body
1	It's ok, yahoo answers is pretty much in consensus that expired oxycodone is OK. If anything it may be less effective so I should take MORE
1	Ok, if I'm going to test this (slightly) expired oxycodone then it stands to reason I should be at work when I do. #Adventure
1	Shew Lawd !!! This Tecfidera is gonna kill me!! Not really, but this flushing is very uncomfortable ! #MSsucks
1	Lamictal dosage increases kind of wreck my head for a day or two. But they also make me super productive as long as I can do things slowly.
1	Well,yesterday was rubbish(post humira)all day in bed,loads of pain etc.Just got up and I think I'm alright?Give it an hour and reassess lol
1	I wish adderall was available over the counter..first time I took son I drank a beer and cleaned the attic lol
1	If Mr Weren't here I'd take a little extra quetiapine and sleep all day. But he is here and I don't think he'll be on board with that :(
1	This Lyrica stuff just makes me want to eat and sleep! #fatkidprobs #hangry
1	Starting Humira tomorrow. :) I wonder if it will make me tired for a day or so like Remicade did. If it works, it's worth it.
1	Seriously considering taking a seroquel just so i can go to sleep omg
1	@stavvers Yeah I hear epilim is pretty tough, sorry to hear re bad times with it :( Oddly, dear sweet Lamotrigine tipped me to a dark place
1	@southkirk @PositiveAboutMS Thinking it might be the baclofen doing it.Only on a low dose though.Broken sleep is a nightmare.#MSFatigue
1	do i come off my medication or do i just continue to be a prozac zombie

1	@jesjosie LMAO. i loved geodon until i started passing out in public and losing chunks of my day. it was good when it was good, though.
1	@OkieVision @GeorgeZisaFatty @MigueleSantos1 no I care, Temazepam and Adderall are pretty strong drugs, cause paranoia amongst other things
1	So I may be allergic to the metoprolol. Rash on my face. Needing my inhaler daily since Friday.
1	@xMandyJayne Trazodone is what he gave me while ago. That shit had me all tore up. I didn't like that shit haha.

1	I ate 2 cakes + 2 pastries at work today. Blaming the quetiapine rather than my liking for cakes. Blaming work too for providing free cake.
1	my mom gave me a caffeine pill and i think it's actually adderall
1	Well! That was icky. I think Lamictal and Lexapro do not get along when taken within 3 hours of each other.
1	I don't like taking Seroquel at night. Makes me crabby the whole time the following day. Something about feeling sluggish and groggy. Aargh.
1	@andresoprano Steady dose of meds, anti-inflams, pain killer and lots of water. Uloric is by far best but kills ur gut.
1	@smrtmnky @Isdcats Oh Christ, how could I forget that!? I can because of Neurontin Man quieting the nerves and whacking the memories.

1	@NeelieB @DavidJuurlink @US_FDA hot flashes won't be around forever; but weaning of paroxetine could be a nightmare
1	Med update? 80mg of Latuda (which gives me the weirdest feeling an hour after taking it) & .5 mg of clonazepam. He won't give me more :(
1	If this test doesn't kill me, the heart attack from the mass amounts of adderall and caffeine in my system surely will.
1	@lil_mermaid NOT A COP AND WANT TO OBTAIN SOME MARIJUANA AND OXYCODONE FOR A REASONABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT PLEASE INSTRUCT
1	Oh and did I tell you I took 60mg of temazepam since I didn't fall asleep I'm high yay me

1	@RayyDePotter yeaa bihh all jacked up on vyvanse!
1	So, I lasted 16 days on Seroquel. I couldn't handle the awful side effects. Constantly dizzy and lightheadeded & a myriad of other bad stuff
1	That Seroquel has been given me some seriously fucked up dreams.
1	@yonniedepp I'm hip, but that's what my other tweet is about lol took too much adderall

1	@Sarahcollier20 @epilepsyaction was on keppra came off them as they stopped me feeling hungry and I lost to much weight I'm now on vimpat
1	@remiamaka It wasn't an easy victory though. Felt like chemo with the Cipro. As for the heart, i meant for study purposes.
1	Morning fluoxetine burp makes me want to ralph.
1	I really feel like this fluoxetine is messing with my perspective time and people.
1	Wow, so I don't think I've talked to my new step dad this much ever. I guess I should not sleep and do adderall more often
1	This new medication is kicking my ass. And I feel flushed. Hope I make it through the night. Restoril is not playing around
1	Apparently, Baclofen greatly exacerbates the "AD" part of my ADHD. Average length of focus today: about 30 seconds.
1	@BlogSazzles i was on keppra for awhile,i had terrible mood swings while i was on it.im on Vimpat now,and dehydration is a major thing.
1	This higher dose of #cymbalta is making me extremely tired and anxious. Is this normal?
1	A fellow RA'er wants to know if Humira causes weight gain?
1	took 5, maybe 10 minutes to go from "why isn't the seroquel working" to "what is a bed, i will just use my keyboard"
1	Oh hey. Much like other anti-convulsants, Lamictal dehydrates you. So much is explained.
1	snorted a line of oxycodone last night & swear i was feeling alllll types of waysss since i was on molly.♡
1	@Purpleviolin91 I haven't been diagnosed with pots but i do have orthostatic hypotension which they say is a side effect of namenda
1	So unfair, I never get the good side effects of meds. Ativan, Seroquel, & Ambien XR make me feel so drink I cant really walk & Im nauseated
1	The one bummer about it all is that the Fluoxetine is giving me the shakes which made fine fiddly detail work harder than it should be
1	@lavenderfuchsia I lost weight in the past but it was much easier. Like 2 steps forward, one step back on the quetiapine.
1	I have so much online homework due today, someone give me adderall

1	Oh for fuck's sake. My mouth is bleeding again. Can't blame the Gabapentin this time. What the fuck???
1	@AaronM effexor was a boner killer, absolutely. welbutrin goes the other way.
1	I asked Vanessa if I could borrow a pair of pants and she hit me with that, "DO U GOT AN ADDERALL I CAN BORROW?"
1	@Glinda_R @SpooniesCouch Cymbalta withdrawal is getting top billing at the moment, however. Ugh! xx
1	Adderall & a few bong rips and its time for class.
1	Had a dream my eyes got burned out of my head. Thank you trazodone
1	@MCifm I have some spare Lexapro and Seroquel if you want any. They keep me from killing myself.
1	@guccigreenery i felt drugged on Ritalin. i love vyvanse. i can't tell i'm on it except for feeling better and calmer and more structured
1	Why do I always get the seroquel munchies!?
1	i can stay up later with less geodon and less zoloft but then i can't fall asleep and want to stay in bed all day. this has been my week
1	@mikedelic if this is a real question, withdrawal from an antidepressant named Effexor was worse than cocaine withdrawal
1	@ABittersweet1 Cipro destroyed my entire body, from head to toe. Bedridden since 2009. Be VERY careful.
1	Owww. I hurt my foot. & am concerned. 1st warning on Cipro is tendon damage. :-/ It certainly wasn't a rupture. I'm sure I'm just paranoid.
1	@TheEastMovie Thank you so much for getting the message out...wish I could see the film but Bayer CRIPPLED ME with Cipro back in 2009!
1	Does anyone happen to know if Lamictal causes you to feel hot? @liberonetwork @_Sabiiiiii #cantstopsweating

1	@MissMazyGG anxiety has been so high. But yeah, if your dosage is high its hard to come off. I had to detox from pristiq (its cousin drug)
1	Ok I've got a med ? Anyone ever tried cymbalta?? My doc put me on it but I slept 10 hrs straight!!
1	@Love__Nino @jesjosie i think geodon really changed my brain. that's crazy (re: wellbutrin). i'm considering going back but still more no
1	College must have been so much tougher back in the day without adderall and there was nothing but mids

1	Me & Keisha really been debating on taking this Seroquel or not for like 20 mins lol
1	Awesome that my mom thinks I'm gonna be a bad influence on my sister now just bc i did adderall and got my nose pierced.
1	Neurontin helps my pain so much but basically puts me in a coma, of course. Can't win
1	Too tired to function right now, thanks Humira. #naptime
1	@jessicama20045 You know that Cipro is also made by Bayer, right? And it ALSO causes a horrific syndrome that mimics an auto-immune disease.
1	#KnowYourAnon I'm addicted to adderall and I've been trying to recover from it but I'm only able to little by little. For more info DM me
1	@INukeYou And then I had horrible sleep once I took the trazodone. I just couldn't win, haha.
1	I really hate the fact that I feel like I need to throw up while at work. Maybe taking my vyvanse wasn't a good idea
1	I firmly believe that every first time mom should be discharged from the hospital with samples of coffee and a prescription to adderall
1	#trazodone is one hell of a sleeping pill. it also makes you feel incredibly high.
1	idk if I'm shaking because I took adderall or if it's because I drank 2 red bulls within 20 minutes earlier
1	“@I_Am_Brendann: I'll be pretty bummed out if I don't take adderall once in my life” that's what I'm saying Adderall sounds fucking great
1	@LISABROWNPHOTOS Consider yourself lucky if all it does is make you dizzy and sick! Cipro crippled me and countless others.
1	@NMCC4 what meds are you on? Gabapentin /pregablin =horrible weight gain. Opiates can cause very bad nausea /stomach pains /vomiting...
1	On a related note: Tysabri causes weight gain. As does body pain/inability to exercise. Sigh. #fuckms
1	@Dani_DeeH Nope, I tested positive for JCV. JCV & Tysabri = permanent brain damage or sudden death.
1	@cloudtoad @MrsYisWhy @bigthink each brain is different. The SSRI I'm on has worked really well. Prozac made me a zombie. #Brains

1	Brb licking the bottom of this altoid tin for crumbs of adderall leftover from coachella...
1	Woo it's so awesome when my Adderall makes me have a rapid heart rate when I run so I look like I'm about to have a heart attack
1	Please be careful when withdrawing from any anti deps, benzos and/or hypnotics. Venlafaxine was a bad choice for me and worse withdrawl.
1	@sianmorgan Oh a bit better! And a bit worse :/ Desvenlafaxine is working for me but the mouth and stomach ulcers aren't very nice.
1	Latuda side effects,not only don't want it for ♡ ones but, don't want 2 hang out with anyone on it.Side effect warnings r like scary movie.

1	@Enlightenmentor Umm, are you being a smart-ass? Dont mess with me right now. Going through Cymbalta withdrawal I think & Im VERY depressed.
1	I try to be sexy, sad or quiet. So I'm ranting about how the antibiotic Levaquin has caused me permanent nerve damage over @FightBigPharma
1	Functioning when on Pregabalin is next to impossible #zombie
1	narcotic, benzo, etc rx's arent the only meds addictive. if i miss a dose of wellbutrin or effexor, my hands shake crazy & i get brain zaps
1	So while I'm letting the thoughts of Lamictal/fatal rashes/tonsillectomy/spinal tap settle, I'm going to go rescue a budgie.
1	@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand Lexapro gave me the worst mixed episodes. I have some instability with Pristiq but I can manage it ok.
1	@SQLSnark @sqlcheesecake @nineball Oxycodone is oxycodone, whoever gives it. Unless you get morphine, nothing beats oxycodone.

1	@AgentMariaHill I've taken the BP daily if not twice a day like I should, it's juz I didn't think the Effexor would spike it so. I'm usually
1	@zacsquiggles The Levaquin is very strong. Not too many side effects for dad. It just takes away all his strength.
1	@MerePrototype Probably the combination with my fluoxetine. But I can't move that to night time, it makes me have bad dreams.
1	@Iamjoy1 yeah I know, I dont take my trazadone at night cause it makes me feel groggy in the morning and I wont wake to my alarm):
1	My body already hates me for the copious amounts of adderall and lack of sleep and food it's about to endure these next few days
1	@SesshaBatto I was prescribed Levaquin w/ Prednisone 3X in 7 mos. Permanent nerve &tendon damage. There are hundreds of thousands of us.
1	I wonder if olanzapine causes restless legs <_<

1	Well. I abruptly stopped taking Lamotrigine (Lamictal), and that is why I am having the pain and weakness. Possible seizure. Oops.

1	this nigga just told me he took Adderall to stay up to PLAY FUCKIN WOW OMFG
1	The Seroquel the doc gave me, makes doing things difficult. . . But if I don't do something, I'll fall asleep. The catch-22 of crazy.

1	08.26 day 14 rivaroxaban diary. Just been to cut some wild roses down so workmen can easily get to part of my garage. Intense back pain.
1	I think this Olanzapine makes me crazier.
1	@thebookgirl985 Trazodone makes me HUNGRY. Prop my eyelids open with toothpicks and drive me to a buffet?
1	Kinda worried about the nighttime jaw clenching from Effexor, what with my tongue ring and all... :L
1	@drugsalad for adderall or norcos? Either way why haven't you given me the hookup before? Hate chu
1	I have got to stop taking my Vyvanse so late!! #nosleep #addproblems
1	Whiskey and scotch . That's all I need..... Well maybe some oxycodone and cocaine too

1	Magically my appetite has gone back to normal since going off seroquel! Well, well, well - I was right, the doctor was wrong.
1	Pretty sure your three cups of coffee means adderall
1	Listens to Oxymoron once. “@HeyltsJ: they gave me oxycodone for the pain but i basically take them because they make me feel good ”

1	I cant imagine how people got through college without adderall
1	The dishes keep piling up in my sink. Can I have an Adderall script?
