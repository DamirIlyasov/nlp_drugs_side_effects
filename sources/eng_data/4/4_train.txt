1	@shinobi_brian hugs I have been put on gabapentin and it is giving me migranes
1	@JenniferannHatc I understand Bystolic does mess with losing weight, but I've still slowly pulled it off. The PTU is a new challenge now.

1	@disabledmedic Quetiapine perhaps gives most dramatic effect for single low dose. No, pts are not being lazy in bed 20 hours a day, asleep!

1	No seriously if you don't want to do homework on the weekends in college, just take adderall once a week. It's seriously the best option

1	I ate 2 cakes + 2 pastries at work today. Blaming the quetiapine rather than my liking for cakes. Blaming work too for providing free cake.
1	my mom gave me a caffeine pill and i think it's actually adderall
1	Well! That was icky. I think Lamictal and Lexapro do not get along when taken within 3 hours of each other.
1	I don't like taking Seroquel at night. Makes me crabby the whole time the following day. Something about feeling sluggish and groggy. Aargh.
1	@andresoprano Steady dose of meds, anti-inflams, pain killer and lots of water. Uloric is by far best but kills ur gut.
1	@smrtmnky @Isdcats Oh Christ, how could I forget that!? I can because of Neurontin Man quieting the nerves and whacking the memories.

1	@NeelieB @DavidJuurlink @US_FDA hot flashes won't be around forever; but weaning of paroxetine could be a nightmare
1	Med update? 80mg of Latuda (which gives me the weirdest feeling an hour after taking it) & .5 mg of clonazepam. He won't give me more :(
1	If this test doesn't kill me, the heart attack from the mass amounts of adderall and caffeine in my system surely will.
1	@lil_mermaid NOT A COP AND WANT TO OBTAIN SOME MARIJUANA AND OXYCODONE FOR A REASONABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT PLEASE INSTRUCT
1	Oh and did I tell you I took 60mg of temazepam since I didn't fall asleep I'm high yay me

1	Effexor side effects; headaches, no appetite.
1	@RayyDePotter yeaa bihh all jacked up on vyvanse!
1	So, I lasted 16 days on Seroquel. I couldn't handle the awful side effects. Constantly dizzy and lightheadeded & a myriad of other bad stuff
1	That Seroquel has been given me some seriously fucked up dreams.
1	@yonniedepp I'm hip, but that's what my other tweet is about lol took too much adderall

1	@Sarahcollier20 @epilepsyaction was on keppra came off them as they stopped me feeling hungry and I lost to much weight I'm now on vimpat
1	@remiamaka It wasn't an easy victory though. Felt like chemo with the Cipro. As for the heart, i meant for study purposes.
1	Morning fluoxetine burp makes me want to ralph.
1	I really feel like this fluoxetine is messing with my perspective time and people.
1	Wow, so I don't think I've talked to my new step dad this much ever. I guess I should not sleep and do adderall more often
1	This new medication is kicking my ass. And I feel flushed. Hope I make it through the night. Restoril is not playing around
1	Apparently, Baclofen greatly exacerbates the "AD" part of my ADHD. Average length of focus today: about 30 seconds.
1	@BlogSazzles i was on keppra for awhile,i had terrible mood swings while i was on it.im on Vimpat now,and dehydration is a major thing.
1	This higher dose of #cymbalta is making me extremely tired and anxious. Is this normal?
1	A fellow RA'er wants to know if Humira causes weight gain?
1	took 5, maybe 10 minutes to go from "why isn't the seroquel working" to "what is a bed, i will just use my keyboard"
1	Oh hey. Much like other anti-convulsants, Lamictal dehydrates you. So much is explained.
1	snorted a line of oxycodone last night & swear i was feeling alllll types of waysss since i was on molly.♡
1	@Purpleviolin91 I haven't been diagnosed with pots but i do have orthostatic hypotension which they say is a side effect of namenda
1	So unfair, I never get the good side effects of meds. Ativan, Seroquel, & Ambien XR make me feel so drink I cant really walk & Im nauseated
1	The one bummer about it all is that the Fluoxetine is giving me the shakes which made fine fiddly detail work harder than it should be
1	@lavenderfuchsia I lost weight in the past but it was much easier. Like 2 steps forward, one step back on the quetiapine.
1	I have so much online homework due today, someone give me adderall
1	@MS_marathon Tired after the tysabri infusion? I am...

1	Only one day in and Mirtazapine is like fluoxetine all over again, it just makes me so tiered
1	Oh for fuck's sake. My mouth is bleeding again. Can't blame the Gabapentin this time. What the fuck???
1	@AaronM effexor was a boner killer, absolutely. welbutrin goes the other way.
1	I asked Vanessa if I could borrow a pair of pants and she hit me with that, "DO U GOT AN ADDERALL I CAN BORROW?"
1	@Glinda_R @SpooniesCouch Cymbalta withdrawal is getting top billing at the moment, however. Ugh! xx
1	Adderall & a few bong rips and its time for class.
1	Had a dream my eyes got burned out of my head. Thank you trazodone
1	@MCifm I have some spare Lexapro and Seroquel if you want any. They keep me from killing myself.
1	@guccigreenery i felt drugged on Ritalin. i love vyvanse. i can't tell i'm on it except for feeling better and calmer and more structured
1	Why do I always get the seroquel munchies!?
1	i can stay up later with less geodon and less zoloft but then i can't fall asleep and want to stay in bed all day. this has been my week
1	@mikedelic if this is a real question, withdrawal from an antidepressant named Effexor was worse than cocaine withdrawal
1	@ABittersweet1 Cipro destroyed my entire body, from head to toe. Bedridden since 2009. Be VERY careful.
1	Owww. I hurt my foot. & am concerned. 1st warning on Cipro is tendon damage. :-/ It certainly wasn't a rupture. I'm sure I'm just paranoid.
1	@TheEastMovie Thank you so much for getting the message out...wish I could see the film but Bayer CRIPPLED ME with Cipro back in 2009!
1	Does anyone happen to know if Lamictal causes you to feel hot? @liberonetwork @_Sabiiiiii #cantstopsweating

1	Tysabri infusion today at hospital. Extra shattered this time. Can't keep my eyes open. #fatigue @MSIRELAND @mssocietyuk
1	@MissMazyGG anxiety has been so high. But yeah, if your dosage is high its hard to come off. I had to detox from pristiq (its cousin drug)
1	Ok I've got a med ? Anyone ever tried cymbalta?? My doc put me on it but I slept 10 hrs straight!!
1	@Love__Nino @jesjosie i think geodon really changed my brain. that's crazy (re: wellbutrin). i'm considering going back but still more no
1	College must have been so much tougher back in the day without adderall and there was nothing but mids

1	@jennyelliott88 FFS!! I'm getting shooting pains down arms & legs now & In eve whole body ache #humira is horrible
1	Me & Keisha really been debating on taking this Seroquel or not for like 20 mins lol
1	Awesome that my mom thinks I'm gonna be a bad influence on my sister now just bc i did adderall and got my nose pierced.
1	Neurontin helps my pain so much but basically puts me in a coma, of course. Can't win
1	Too tired to function right now, thanks Humira. #naptime
1	@jessicama20045 You know that Cipro is also made by Bayer, right? And it ALSO causes a horrific syndrome that mimics an auto-immune disease.
1	#KnowYourAnon I'm addicted to adderall and I've been trying to recover from it but I'm only able to little by little. For more info DM me
1	@INukeYou And then I had horrible sleep once I took the trazodone. I just couldn't win, haha.
1	I really hate the fact that I feel like I need to throw up while at work. Maybe taking my vyvanse wasn't a good idea
1	I firmly believe that every first time mom should be discharged from the hospital with samples of coffee and a prescription to adderall
1	#trazodone is one hell of a sleeping pill. it also makes you feel incredibly high.
1	idk if I'm shaking because I took adderall or if it's because I drank 2 red bulls within 20 minutes earlier
1	“@I_Am_Brendann: I'll be pretty bummed out if I don't take adderall once in my life” that's what I'm saying Adderall sounds fucking great
1	@LISABROWNPHOTOS Consider yourself lucky if all it does is make you dizzy and sick! Cipro crippled me and countless others.
1	@NMCC4 what meds are you on? Gabapentin /pregablin =horrible weight gain. Opiates can cause very bad nausea /stomach pains /vomiting...
1	On a related note: Tysabri causes weight gain. As does body pain/inability to exercise. Sigh. #fuckms
1	@Dani_DeeH Nope, I tested positive for JCV. JCV & Tysabri = permanent brain damage or sudden death.
1	@cloudtoad @MrsYisWhy @bigthink each brain is different. The SSRI I'm on has worked really well. Prozac made me a zombie. #Brains

0	my doctor just prescribed me a big bottle of liquid oxycodone thnks for the soon to be drug problem doc
0	@AmyBadkin yes, Humira pens are large and kind of clunky. They work well but its a bit of a jab for sure. I prefer syringes.

1	Fucking Effexor withdrawals. I would shake my fist but I don't have the energy.
1	@AnyssiaKaissa Depakote made me feel flat, but helps many. Zyprexa can cause weight gain, so be very careful. I can't tolerate it.
1	Oh, and I forgot that with Lamotrigine come awful night terrors. I woke up no fewer than five times screaming and sweaty. #lol
1	I need to progress onto oxazepam.Apparently it's more sedating. Seroquel is sedating, but you can hardly open or close your mouth.

1	The cymbalta certainly is addictive & its FDA approved...
1	Rivaroxaban is great, until your patient gets a wound and bleeds solidly for 14hours from it!
1	Woke up with my januvia flu symptoms. Managed to plan out homeschool for the summer but that is about it for today. Suddenly it is 5.
1	jeremy gave me an adderall tho so we'll see how this goes pray 4 me

1	I feel like Costco is to suburban moms as adderall is to UES moms.
1	Sleeping my life away on #quetiapine. Fine by me.
1	I've taken everything but my Trazodone that's tonight, but the nasal spray is giving me a drip :|
1	A mixture of Diazepam and Temazepam to make myself sleep was maybe not the greatest idea. I feel like the whole world is spinning around me.
1	#EdwardCovongton says the cocaine and seroquel "made me do this, it's not me. Lisa loved me" he is beginning to get emotional
1	NEW LAUNCH ITEM! SKY now offers Quetiapine Fumarate 100ct tablets in 100mg, 200mg, and 300mg strengths. Place your order now!
1	if you don't hear from me for awhile it's bc my mom just walked in on me snorting adderall with a boy

1	welll..decided to get off paxil. withdrawals are killlerrr, like loss of circulation randomly in areas.
1	Brb licking the bottom of this altoid tin for crumbs of adderall leftover from coachella...
1	Woo it's so awesome when my Adderall makes me have a rapid heart rate when I run so I look like I'm about to have a heart attack
1	Please be careful when withdrawing from any anti deps, benzos and/or hypnotics. Venlafaxine was a bad choice for me and worse withdrawl.
1	@sianmorgan Oh a bit better! And a bit worse :/ Desvenlafaxine is working for me but the mouth and stomach ulcers aren't very nice.
1	Latuda side effects,not only don't want it for ♡ ones but, don't want 2 hang out with anyone on it.Side effect warnings r like scary movie.

1	So much shit to do today and so much homework. adderall for sure today
1	@Shellyfanelly I was on #azathioprine for about 8 years, it worked well, now on #Humira instead though which is knocking me about
1	Trying to figure out an AP physics problem while on adderall is an adventure
1	@dsmpowered tolerance is built up super fast with them so people search for a stronger high. I took 5 Oxycodone at one time to feel it.
1	06.30 day 14 Rivaroxaban diary. Thanks to paracetamol and hot water bottle I had 4 hrs continuous sleep. Woke uo with frontal headache, 1/2
1	@dsymons @trainingwithra I agree that the after sting is much worse from #humira than #enbrel #rheum

1	@thebeecharmer97 @deadfanclub I would NOT recommend toying around with Cipro if you don't have to. Did you know it can cripple you for life?
1	@Enlightenmentor Umm, are you being a smart-ass? Dont mess with me right now. Going through Cymbalta withdrawal I think & Im VERY depressed.
1	I try to be sexy, sad or quiet. So I'm ranting about how the antibiotic Levaquin has caused me permanent nerve damage over @FightBigPharma
1	Functioning when on Pregabalin is next to impossible #zombie
1	narcotic, benzo, etc rx's arent the only meds addictive. if i miss a dose of wellbutrin or effexor, my hands shake crazy & i get brain zaps
1	So while I'm letting the thoughts of Lamictal/fatal rashes/tonsillectomy/spinal tap settle, I'm going to go rescue a budgie.
1	@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand Lexapro gave me the worst mixed episodes. I have some instability with Pristiq but I can manage it ok.
1	@SQLSnark @sqlcheesecake @nineball Oxycodone is oxycodone, whoever gives it. Unless you get morphine, nothing beats oxycodone.
1	@AClassyStoner_ I'd take some oxycodone before that. I need a high that will last.
1	13.08 Day 13 Rivaroxaban diary. Pracetamol has taken away most of the aches, but still have lower back ache and weak knees.

1	@zacsquiggles The Levaquin is very strong. Not too many side effects for dad. It just takes away all his strength.
1	@MerePrototype Probably the combination with my fluoxetine. But I can't move that to night time, it makes me have bad dreams.
1	@Iamjoy1 yeah I know, I dont take my trazadone at night cause it makes me feel groggy in the morning and I wont wake to my alarm):
1	My body already hates me for the copious amounts of adderall and lack of sleep and food it's about to endure these next few days
1	@SesshaBatto I was prescribed Levaquin w/ Prednisone 3X in 7 mos. Permanent nerve &tendon damage. There are hundreds of thousands of us.
1	I wonder if olanzapine causes restless legs <_<
1	@ItsMeCreezy I hate to hear that. Taking seroquel is like swallowing a sleeping pill when u wake up then trying to function normally
1	Vimpat makes me exhaugsted!!
1	My mom just asked my grandpa if he had ibuprofen and he replies "no but I got oxycodone and I'm addicted to them and they're great"

1	Well. I abruptly stopped taking Lamotrigine (Lamictal), and that is why I am having the pain and weakness. Possible seizure. Oops.
1	I'm surprised more players don't get busted for amphetamines. College folks pop adderall like candy to focus, so you know MLB guys do, too.
1	this nigga just told me he took Adderall to stay up to PLAY FUCKIN WOW OMFG
1	The Seroquel the doc gave me, makes doing things difficult. . . But if I don't do something, I'll fall asleep. The catch-22 of crazy.

1	I got some oxycodone who tryna buy it off me? $6 a pill

1	08.26 day 14 rivaroxaban diary. Just been to cut some wild roses down so workmen can easily get to part of my garage. Intense back pain.
1	I think this Olanzapine makes me crazier.
1	@thebookgirl985 Trazodone makes me HUNGRY. Prop my eyelids open with toothpicks and drive me to a buffet?
1	Kinda worried about the nighttime jaw clenching from Effexor, what with my tongue ring and all... :L
1	@drugsalad for adderall or norcos? Either way why haven't you given me the hookup before? Hate chu
1	I have got to stop taking my Vyvanse so late!! #nosleep #addproblems
1	Whiskey and scotch . That's all I need..... Well maybe some oxycodone and cocaine too
1	How anyone can say there is no withdrawal from prozac withdrawal is beyond me. Their answer is to go back on it and up the dose.
1	Venlafaxine hangover finally starting to shift after 2 huge mugs of hot water with giant pieces of lemon...
1	Has anyone tried the humira shot, I heard it feels like hot lava going thru your skin for the first seconds but my doctor wants me to get it

1	my mom just threw away her Oxycodone from when she was sick, but now it's mine.
1	I have been on Seroquel (Quetiapine) for so long I don't even know what the side-effects are! Although, I think overheating is definitely 1.
1	Magically my appetite has gone back to normal since going off seroquel! Well, well, well - I was right, the doctor was wrong.
1	Pretty sure your three cups of coffee means adderall
1	Listens to Oxymoron once. “@HeyltsJ: they gave me oxycodone for the pain but i basically take them because they make me feel good ”
1	@KevinEC13 see I love oxycodone but roxis don't keep me high for very long, I gotta keep eating them hoes to stay high.. I like OP80s mmmm

1	Not winking at you Mr. Barista, I just way overdid it with the espresso shots & adderall today

1	@rioxide I'm sure if I went full time and stocked up on adderall I could be dmg in a year but that's only if I slept/playedsgo/repeat
1	i had the two humira shots today and the needle didnt hurt at all but the mEDICINE INSIDE BURNED LIKE LAVA
1	Gotta find an alternative to Vyvanse, ASAP. I'd rather be sleepy & happy, than alert & depressed!
1	I cant imagine how people got through college without adderall
1	The dishes keep piling up in my sink. Can I have an Adderall script?
1	Took some expired adderall this afternoon but didn't end up going out. Wide awake for nothing. Cool.

1	Bedtime. Hopefully the headache and nausea from the Levaquin will be gone leaving me with only the more common side effects of antibiotics.
1	So this time of night I can choose Lyrica (beware swollen throat, colon, penis, et. al.) or Adam and Eve. Same result.
