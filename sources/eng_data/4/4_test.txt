1	Taking adderall the rest of the week so I can actually do my research paper #dontmindme #illbeoutofit #fucked
1	RP McMurphy was right about the trazodone being my new favorite bed-buddy. RIP, melatonin dreams. You were getting too weird - even for me.

1	21.36 day 9 Rivaroxaban diary. Particularly bad lower back ache had not eased by 14.00 so went to bed. Much better when I woke at 19.00.
1	why do I not remember going to bed or waking up (the answer: probably seroquel)
1	@NireBryce Thanks. There is a nonzero chance that the discomfort I am feeling was caused by going back on Cymbalta, possibly too quickly.
1	So, my Pregabalin was supposed to be being increased...but is now being decreased due to horrible dry eyes and mouth side effect. :(
1	Will still be on the Geodon, but will also be taking a low-dose alprazolam as needed for the sudden anxiety attacks ive been getting
1	Not to mention the thousands of people online who say they’ve stacked on the weight due to taking seroquel.
1	Adderall can actually keep me awake for days on end without an hour of sleep at all , and I hate that.
1	@abianne the Effexor may have been pushing me toward hypomania, so we are trying just an ssri, then see if a mood stabilizer is needed.

1	finals week tip: make sure u poop, pee, and eat tums before u take adderall to study; all of which will help u retain the drug in ur body
1	It's ok, yahoo answers is pretty much in consensus that expired oxycodone is OK. If anything it may be less effective so I should take MORE

1	Shew Lawd !!! This Tecfidera is gonna kill me!! Not really, but this flushing is very uncomfortable ! #MSsucks

1	@OkieVision @GeorgeZisaFatty @MigueleSantos1 no I care, Temazepam and Adderall are pretty strong drugs, cause paranoia amongst other things
