1	"U wailed all night; now y'r disembodied sobbing all damn'd day, ghost?" • EFFEXOR-XR®DISCONTINUATION SYNDROME AIN'T EXACTLY HEAVEN, ANGEL
1	Not that anyone noticed, but my #ambienwithdrawl only lasted a few days. Why? Because I got another scrip. I need it while I'm on Levaquin.
1	Finding out I'm allergic to fluoxetine was a bit of a shock tho. Mind, only someone from yorkshire could be actually allergic to prozac
1	Off to see the gi consultant this week. Hope theres something other than humira to try as not working also hair falling out.
1	@evann_lfc yea still a vampire as still on cipro wbu? Xx
1	Geez this vyvanse makes me talk a mile a minute haha
1	my nigga dante addicted to that nicotine
1	The 100mg tabs of trazodone my gp prescribed are too much, now that I don't take them every night. Still zombieish after an hour awake.
1	@stacymadern thats the prob with Zyprexa its for ppl with Bi-Polar or Schizophrenia its really strong when you wake up your drowsy for 6 hrs
1	Since quetiapine's messed with my prolactin levels, making my boobs humungous & my bras so expensive, I want a lingerie component to DLA.
1	@stark3923 cipro has a known warning of weakening the Achilles tendon. ...
1	Screw you Paxil! You do wonders for anxiety but you make me a ultra lightweight
1	Also, yay addiction. It's drugs i need for living, but it's still dependance. every time i get a "paxil headache" i realize this. oh well.
1	I am way too hyper to go home and do nothing tonight :( damn Prozac >.<
1	Rivaroxaban 2/2 lower back pain. Not very PC but am crippled by this drug. Taking more paracetamols. Must ring for 'phone consultation.
1	@dougmoneybags quetiapine. Very low dose even with increase. Helps me get to sleep (& eat in general) but feel really groggy in the morning
1	That nap was on point.... Cymbalta did that shit cuz I dont take naps...ever
1	I wish I could be tired. Shouldn't have taken the vyvanse. Now I'm never sleeping.
1	@Jakefletcha @Becki_65roses Cipro is real bad on your entire body! Take it from me (on disability since '09 thanks to just 12 pills).
1	I'd rather be on the Effexor that made me happy though I had severe back pain from it.. Than sad and crying for no reason on lexapro....
1	Question time #crohns #ibd #humira does anyone suffer from egg burps? What works for you
1	19.32 day 20 Rivaroxaban diary. Still residual aches and pains; only had 4 paracetamol today.
1	why do I not remember going to bed or waking up (the answer: probably seroquel)
1	Only one day in and Mirtazapine is like fluoxetine all over again, it just makes me so tiered
1	Just about dead, think it's bedtime.. Fuck you quetiapine
1	The day after Humira used to be a great one, full of energy, low pain. After a month, it is now a fatigue filled achy day. #rheum
1	Day has been a right off. Missed opticians&slept aw day. Sitting here torn faced, wi greasy hair&unwashed. Swollen feet thx to olanzapine.
1	@JessBarrett227 Taking someone off 150mg off Seroquel, mixing it with Olanzapine in 2 wks causes psychosis - a proper assess was not done.
1	@BLEDNOS Lamictal and trileptal and seroquel...of course the seroquel I take in severe situations because gaining weight is never cool
1	@HDAwareness cause UCD sayed I had Huntington's disease for like 8 yrs, then said high dose zyprexa caused a false diagnosis. I think I have
1	Hello, world! Quetiapine zombie this morning and I have a work call in about 45 minutes. Perfect combination.
1	@Joanne__Howe enbrel is a miracle but it made my eyes worse :( so couldn't have it anymore :(
1	Actually it was more like a prison but with nurses instead of guards, olanzapine pill n IM= #zombies
1	@drdrew I recently stopped taking effexor 225 what can i do to ease my withdrawls?I feel miserable right now and very angry.Please any ideas
1	What to do? Not looking forward to cold turkey withdrawals from Pristiq... sense of impending doom. Anxiety only makes the situation worse.
1	Rivaroxaban diary ctd , neck and should ache, lower back pain and knee ache.
1	@david82wilkins @CFAware Neither of you appear to be aware that Cipro can cripple otherwise healthy people...doctor fail to mention that?
1	Pt of mine died from Cipro RT @CIPROisPOISON: @gastromom If only more doctors thought like you! I lost my entire life to 12 Cipro pills
1	I'm loosing so much blood right now. Humira is some scurry ish.
1	Getting a seven page text of garbled ramblings from someone detailing that their titrating of venlafaxine led to a break up is unusual.
1	Anyone who will listen: never ever take Effexor/Venlafaxine. Paraesthesia abound.
1	Just wondering where the side effect of hating the world is stated on vyvanse advertisements?
1	venlafaxine makes me feel so nauseas hahahaha oh god I'm going to chunder in my geography lesson help
1	Toothache. Discovered that somewhere in the paracetamol, codeine, sertraline #quetiapine combination there is a bad mix. #hallucinating
1	@PosAware my t cell went up w ith humira I also have crohns disease. I wish u guys had more articles with people like me in it
1	Oh, and I forgot that with Lamotrigine come awful night terrors. I woke up no fewer than five times screaming and sweaty. #lol
1	@SpicyNyx fluoxetine and quet combo zombified me...ah, the meds merrygoround #bipolar
1	Hmm, interesting. I may have been undergoing Baclofen withdrawal hence the anxiety for the past few months… #hypochondria
1	@illtreaturite1 Fluox a friend 4 years, but switch to cymbalta 4 anti-depress/pain control. I OCD worry. Can't stop running mind
1	@fragileannie @meilufay I tried Baclofen, another common muscle relaxer, and had too many side-effects from it, including worsening pain.
1	@skernandez because I realized Vyvanse after a certain time of taking it increased my anxiety and made me more irrational.
1	@neomoms I had been blaming my dizziness upon standing to my menopause but now on HRT & no more flashes so looked at cymbalta side effs
1	So I may be allergic to the metoprolol. Rash on my face. Needing my inhaler daily since Friday.
1	@Glass1ncision -nods- My zombie-ness when I first wake up in the morning is mostly from my nightly meds too (Seroquel).
1	Do not ever get on Cymbalta. Getting off of it is HELL!
1	My vyvanse is seriously about to drive me crazy
1	Almost vomited on a zinc lozenge #yuk
1	can't sleep, but i'm afraid that the muscle tremors keep me awake even worse if i take promethazine in combination with fluoxetine...
1	People taking #quetiapine - does this need to sleep 24/7 go eventually? Cos this is not sustainable beyond the short term.
1	@weswroten @bullfrogr wow Paxil sent me into a huge hypo manic mixed episode.
1	Lamotrigine causing steven johnson syndrome
1	@Shellyfanelly I was on #azathioprine for about 8 years, it worked well, now on #Humira instead though which is knocking me about
1	@thekillmars300 called lamictal (for anxiety) that turns out I'm allergic to also. Kicker is, they both can cause SJS. I never had a chance.
1	@sapphire20 to it, and now I'm on Humira with just the bloat to battle. Things sometimes get super shitty in every sense. But stay strong xx
1	@brokenmind_ Quetiapine was horrific for me in relation to wait gain. Such a horror story. But the weight will come off one day at a time.
1	No one likes me on my Vyvanse #TooChill #Zombiemode
1	@neurobonkers also, "meth mouth" is really poverty mouth. u don't c when people take it for ADHD. nor in Prozac, which similarly dries mouth
1	"...but then Staph is all like 'I'll just mutate my gyrase gene,' and suddenly everyone's *shocked* it's Levaquin resistant! Psh." #OHonID
1	This night of no sleep is brought to you by Vyvanse. 
1	Woke up to breakfast in bed...well couch because I'm addicted to the new 3D wifi tv. Too bad I have no appetite. Thanks Cymbalta.
1	@JameeTMiller I didn't have side effects when I started taking Cymbalta. After about 6 mths had to stop because it raised my blood pressure.
1	Little did I know that I would go through withdrawals when coming off of Effexor XR. #antidepressants
1	@Glinda_R @SpooniesCouch Cymbalta withdrawal is getting top billing at the moment, however. Ugh! xx
1	I've been on Paxil for 10 years for depression/anxiety and at first it used to help but I guess I've built up tolerance and I come too fast.
1	@teepeewest Did you get floxed too? I've been in bed since 2009 thanks to just 12 Cipro pills! They never told me this can be permanent!!!
1	@joshuagates You forgot the immodium for when the Cipro kills all the good bacteria. :) #travelskills
1	Owww. I hurt my foot. & am concerned. 1st warning on Cipro is tendon damage. :-/ It certainly wasn't a rupture. I'm sure I'm just paranoid.
1	@Justjeffpls Seroquel can cause high blood sugars, talk to your Dr. exercise everyday. Lose weight. If U have type 1, ask someone else
1	SO IT FUCKING TURNS OUT THAT A SIDE EFFECT OF EFFEXOR IS A LOSS OF APPETITE
1	@anwen @Ellwynnnnn Venlafaxine withdrawal is worse than most by miles x
1	@gastromom WOW...if only more doctors thought like you!! I lost my entire life to twelve Cipro pills.
1	Rivaroxaban diary day 22. Last tablet taken Tuesday 18th, 4 days ago. Woken up in pain. Bad fluid retention (uneven) on both legs.
1	I have got to stop taking my Vyvanse so late!! #nosleep #addproblems
1	@McMorag my dreams became vivider I think with Effexor #BPDChat
1	The Seroquel the doc gave me, makes doing things difficult. . . But if I don't do something, I'll fall asleep. The catch-22 of crazy.
1	So I ran out of Victoza before payday & restarted it yesterday. Bleh: nausea. It did help me lose @ 10 lbs. but I found 3 when I ran out.
1	Trazodone is no joke. Slept through every alarm.
1	All nighter is killing me right now, I hate you vyvanse
1	Wide awake and this trazodone starting to feel like a sugar pill.. I'd actually prefer to be at work right bout now.
1	@KarimS3D Olanzapine actually makes you put on weight, even when you aren't eating that much
1	Anyway, I was just feeling itchy and my neck was red so they gave me benedryl with my #tysabri. Might be a coincidence but just in case
1	That Seroquel has been given me some seriously fucked up dreams.
1	@ajswurld I'm allergic to Enbrel :-( bad reaction
1	@PArthritis I don't know that one, but metho made me sick everyday I took it. I had to stop. Enbrel has worked wonders for me .. so far
1	But I don't want to take an ambien or trazodone or anything because i dint wanna restart my dependence upon them
1	@RealHausfrau @Tantalizinyou my step-dad was on Effexer,taking supplements for energy and drinking like a fish when he shot my daughter&me
1	02.20 Day 19 Rivaroxaban Diary woken up with pains in head, neck, back, hip and legs. Seeing Doc in 7 hours. No way am I continuin with Rvxn
1	my sim card isn't working aaggh i feel like im having cymbalta withdrawal again aaagh aaaggh
1	“@vyvanseswag: I run on Vyvanse and RedBull.” So done with that life. Vyvance cooked my brain like a stove top
1	just wondering why doctors prescribe dangerous, addictive medications without any warning to patients. Paxil, for instance.
1	@NeelieB @DavidJuurlink @US_FDA hot flashes won't be around forever; but weaning of paroxetine could be a nightmare
1	ugh I wish my vyvanse didn't make my stomach hurt so bad
1	#effexor #withdrawl is a monster that i have taken by the horns and am wrestling to the ground...this time i am winning! 7thdayfree
1	Dabigatran not working in this obese pt, maybe contributing to his stroke. Saved by tPA.... Speechlesshttp://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1215900?af=R&rss=currentIssue&utm_source=feedly …
1	God humira shots blow so bad... #painful #crohnssucks
1	Question: anyone on #humira experiencing urinary track infections frequently and never had before?
1	@lucilleparr I take quetiapine and it's supposed to just relax me I end up falling asleep within 2 hours. My brain's always scattered haha
1	whoa quetiapine stop making me feel drowsy yo
1	So unfair, I never get the good side effects of meds. Ativan, Seroquel, & Ambien XR make me feel so drink I cant really walk & Im nauseated
1	Half awake and po'd! 60mg of baclofen and 14mg of valium.... legs still spasmed too much to get tatted. I hatechyu legs!
1	This seroquel got me lo0o0py as helll. This status took me at least thirty minutes to type I keep waking up without knowing I feel asleep
1	@duncantrussell I watched that movie "Side Effects" while coming off Paxil and relapsed
1	Panic attacking because you cant find your Effexor and know withdrawal will set in momentarily <<<<<<<.
1	Tysabri infusion #54 yesterday. Made me feel tired and out of it for a while. Maybe it's the heat - 34C (94F)!!! Maybe a VERY HOT summer?
1	Is it hot in here or is my Vyvanse just kicking in?
1	DOC for Panic disorders: alprazolam (addictive) and paroxetine (sedating). #psychiatry
1	been taking low dosage of paroxetine for the last two years and only recently found out that a common side affect is pinsandneedles.
1	01.10 day 13 rivaroxaban diary. Headache over right side of head; lower back pain. Wrote letter to my GP & his colleague outlining problems
1	@catch_n_reLISE Not sure what antibiotic that was in the pic (maybe Bactrim??), but dairy products reduce the efficacy of ciprofloxacin
1	@MTV When are you going to do True Life: I am addicted to Vyvanse?
1	@adelerosenbloom Getting off Seroquel (Sero-KILL) can cause convulsions, fever, toxic reactions, psychotic reactions. and other shit
1	can't even enjoy this banana right now because of fuckin vyvanse what is life
1	@catthoma Right, some SSRIs are used for cataplexy, as is Effexor. Can be tricky to wean off without rebound. #nchat
1	@juntei My old ones took 2 days for withdrawals but Effexor which I'm on now I will get them the next day :/ I wish I could email you valium
1	@johncheese I hated effexor. It makes you hungry, dizzy, and lethargic. That culminated in a large weight gain for me.
1	@ShipMom Cipro is awful makes me sick as a dog too
1	Well my effexor kinda did its job to keep my anxiety under control.... but now to get my heart rate down..... ugh
1	#bpdchat I take seroquel at night, high dose. It knocks me out
1	@PArthritis I don't know that one, but metho made me sick everyday I took it. I had to stop. Enbrel has worked wonders for me .. so far
1	@tittuck i know it made me want to be sick every time i had it plus fluoxetine is the bigges bunch of shit ive been on worse than sertraline
1	In need of a dream interpreter.. #quetiapine is really having an affect on my night visions.. Some fucked up scenarios in my sleep LOL :-/
1	@IntegrateMD I sure wish my doctor had told me Cipro could disable me for life! There was never any mention of that. Now I'm crippled.
1	vyvanse makes me think too much 
1	08.15 day 13 Rivaroxaban diary. Lower back ache, neck ache, hips and knees ache, short of breath, (am asthmatic) taken 2paracetamol, to bed.
1	I hate my new medication. It makes me feel hungry :-( #quetiapine
1	21.36 day 9 Rivaroxaban diary. Particularly bad lower back ache had not eased by 14.00 so went to bed. Much better when I woke at 19.00.
1	@inarticulate I haven't had an orgasm in a long time.. Wtf.. #paxil
1	The drugs don't work!!! From fit to hobbling in a few days. Off the pills but may need wks to recover & be prone to ruptures #ciprofloxacin
1	@gastromom The only pt of mine who ever died was one age 21 profound autism chronic underwt & GI issues, given lots of Cipro. Terrible
1	Personal frustration med's that work (Humira) then wear-off even when taking MTX for anti-bodies. #rheum
1	@OUCH_UK didnt know Lamotrigine was addictive Stopped as didnt think were helping @clusterheads 3 days of hell before realized, back on now
1	Rivaroxaban diary day 22. Am beginning to think all pains from pressure on that part of body are due to fluid retention.
1	Has anyone tried the humira shot, I heard it feels like hot lava going thru your skin for the first seconds but my doctor wants me to get it
1	@upasbook Great read as always. I was on Cymbalta for 5 days. Cold turkey had sweats, migraine, tremors while on & 3 days after.
1	Tell you okes what: When your Dr. says only take Seroquel at night, only take it at night. Zombiness galore.
1	@guccigreenery i felt drugged on Ritalin. i love vyvanse. i can't tell i'm on it except for feeling better and calmer and more structured
1	Thank God it is finally get cooler in London. I have been melting all day! I wonder if my medication reduces my tolerance to heat? #Seroquel
1	@annaspargoryan benzos don't work for me & I've had a cracker of a panic attack on seroquel. listening to people chat on podcasts helps me.
1	Stopped #seroquel for 2 months as it caused terrible side effect. Had to start back up or lose my job #hotflashes r soooo fun #thisismylife
1	@foggymelon @movmctov @The_Scottymomma when I did Humira for my Crohn's it felt like acid, hubby had to shoot me up. Made my lupus flare too
1	@SonnieDetore I cannot be in the sun! #levaquin
1	Why seroquel can make me put on 20 over kg: it acts like an insulin blocker or something.
1	I guess this is what I get for doubling my vyvanse #nosleep
1	Oh. Delayed reaction from Humira injections-my hip joints just started hurting. Haha.
1	@sarahchoueiry @crohns_twins i also have nuasea and low grade temp and on #humira should i go check it out??
1	@jessindia I take fluoxetine and quetiapine. The quetiapine is the one with the massive sleepies, althouth the flouxetine doesn''t help.
1	@Chavielle i has beta blockers now, apparently the fluoxetine can cause panic attacks ^_^
1	The cymbalta certainly is addictive & its FDA approved...
1	@ElectroSocket I was on enbrel for 8 years have since developed neuro problems (ataxia) wish id never taken it side effects not worth risks
1	@BipolarBlogger yeah, generic Venlafaxine has about four different slow release formulations, I got withdrawals from some.
1	@DoctorMcPA Had my doctor attempted to treat with bactrim prior to Cipro, I wouldn't be crippled today.
1	olanzapine is supposed to make you a fat bastard i got off lucky. lithium makes my hand shake. bipolar or schizo drugs.
1	Just had a marathon sleep past 24hrs on new dose of #duloxetine -hope my liver will be ok on it.Woke with stressy tummy pains. #sideeffects
1	I'm so irritable when my vyvanse wears off #fuckkk
1	@elladeruiter oh I hate that! I used to be on citalopram, it stopped working eventually. sometimes I have to up my effexor dose temporarily.
1	@Poet_Carl_Watts @Yueesei ... used to be on them #justaddanother ...worst was the psychotic episode when starting #paxil but one of my favs
1	god there is nothing worse than nicotine withdrawal
1	@AaronM effexor was a boner killer, absolutely. welbutrin goes the other way.
1	@Nichole_Lindsey I've had Cipro before. Luckily for me, the only side fx I tend to get from AB is gastic upset. But I RARELY use AB.
1	@theotherrift can also get "extrapyramidal symptoms" ie tremor from olanzapine.
1	@rickywarwick So true Ricky! I went into anaphylactic shock & almost died from taking Cipro! Dangerous drug - be careful!! Take care.
1	@calyxxx same with venlafaxine, 1 user I spoke to yrs ago stopped taking that when she started having acid like trips losing hours at a time
1	Results of accidentally taking 100 mg of vyvanse last night: I took it at 11:00am and was wide awake until 3:30 this morning..
1	Throbbing headache from not having my pills. 2 pills left I need to save. This sucks :( #paroxetine #socialanxiety
1	Day five of no effexor. I am guessing this is what it feels like when you come off heroin... #discontinuation
1	This Lamictal shit ain't cuttin the mustard; any "mood stabilizers" that don't steal your soul & make u a bloated zombie a la Britney?
1	the come down on vyvanse kicks my ass every time
1	@benderbach cause humira gives me a lot of rashes and like most of these drugs.. Skin sensitivity happens
1	@Clarketacular Fanapt was the only thing that calmed her rages but comes with tremors. I'm so sorry :(
1	Upped my Effexor dosage 5 days ago. Sleep cycle and quality went to shit 4 days ago. I sense a correlation here...
1	Effexor withdrawal.
1	vyvanse makes me think too much 
1	I might have gained 30 lbs in 6 weeks on Zyprexa...Haven't lost that weight yet, and it's been 12 years now. Call doc if it happens to you.
1	@crescentcolours that'll be the quetiapine making you drowsy. It's a common side effect xx
1	I LOVE this Effexor! MAJORLY kills my libido.
1	@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand I'm with you. Even though the Pristiq works, I still don't feel fully human.
1	@Fatuglyew thing about venlafaxine is the withdrawals when you're late for a dose - it's like electric shocks in your brain, and they go -
1	@missynomatter i was on quetiapine and gained 40lbs <wall> so i am not even trying olanzapine. they gave me abilify cause it not supposed to
1	Ready for bed but vyvanse is saying no #forciblynocturnal
1	@Showbizmom48 MRI showed lesions in my noggin :S Got to have EEG to see if its MS or Humira doing it.So more tests n messing about lolxx
1	@santypas @scrabalisios I'm taking 700mg pregablin and 60 mg duloxetine hence why I'm totally mashed
1	Dr. Stephen Huff: pinpoint pupils? Think olanzapine overdose! #demc13
1	@river__tam olanzapine is amazing srsly, the dreams are immense, no addiction, its gorgeous, like brave new world soma to me
1	Oh... oh my hair is... definitely falling out. ._. I just noticed it starting tonight. Google tells me other people on Lamictal have this.
1	Oh man! I've been a total quetiapine zombie all morning! I've been taking them for years but every now + then they really mess me up!
1	So my body was goin threw withdrawl? Lol didnt kno Paxil was that strong lol
1	My 3 favourite things about fluoxetine are: It doesnt work as an antidepressant. Increases suicidal thoughts. It stops you from jizzing.
1	Since quetiapine's messed with my prolactin levels, making my boobs humungous & my bras so expensive, I want a lingerie component to DLA.
1	Does anyone happen to know if Lamictal causes you to feel hot? @liberonetwork @_Sabiiiiii #cantstopsweating
1	Lamictal dosage increases kind of wreck my head for a day or two. But they also make me super productive as long as I can do things slowly.
1	@almostwell yeh same bk felt like sumo wrestler on it all time :( think its f****ed me 4life :( ironic as Humira is used to treat artheritis
1	That seroquel had me sleepy as fuck alllll damn day
1	So apparently 60mgs of Prozac will make you scared of eating GMO's and make you think you need to save the world! Switching back to 40mgs!!!
1	@HurtBlogger good luck! Have you tried it before? Does it work 4 u? I just had 2nd dose of Humira, and hurting so bad I can't stand it :-(
1	Anemia, hormones, depression & Paxil are totally getting the best of me this morning. Getting out of bed is haaard.
1	Took 2 Baclofen 10mg & 1 Ibuprofen 800mg & now i'm laying flat on my back. #ExtremePain #CantGetComfortable
1	Whoah so DIZZING. Damn Tamazapam - shld probably wap back to quetiapine if this keeps up! But it makes me feel so Ick!
1	@DoctorChristian @C4Dispatch re victoza I was prescribed this in 2010 for obesity. Caused pancreatitis and digestive problems ever since
1	"No taste for you" -vyvanse
1	@Sombrera The only medication (of which I am aware...and I know almost all of them) that has a regular headache side-effect is lamictal.
1	@iamthattgirl Ugh, sorry. This effexor is not making me feel so awesome. Posting Puck's stuff tonight though.
1	@zmiller1902 Sometimes my Humira pens make me feel like I'm 90 years old due to the joint pain everywhere.
1	Restless arms & legs! Blood quetiapine :-/
1	I think my tablets have made me gain weight. Anyone on fluoxetine/prozac? #replytweet
1	Rivaroxaban diary day 25 muscle & back pains were due to being on Rvxbn for 10 days, on it + Losartan for 8 days, + Losartan only for 4 days
1	02.50 day 15 Rivaroxaban diary. Neck ache and lower back pain. Had to kneel on floor to get out of bed.
1	This new baccy is just making my cough so much worse but ahhh well need my nicotine
1	Gimme one reason why I shouldn't have sex drive / libido. I accept this as a part of withdrawal symptoms from Venlafaxine. :O
1	@chenoite @CSB_22 yes def eat or the cipro will tear u up and feel better :-)
1	It's raining. I ran for the bus when I didn't need to. My GP letter isn't right. Sweating like a pig thanks to quetiapine. Brighton bound!
1	@DeanMikel I'm not lazy!! My seroquel knocked me out!!
1	@ObsidianVormund Was on Seroquel for years in my teens & stopped taking it. A 'quack' doc put me back on it & I gained 50 in 3 months.
1	@badboyfloyd_ lmao, i'm prescribed baby. it's for my anxiety. i take seroquel, and celexa with it. i'm a fucking zombie after 9pm.
1	Took a percocet for my tooth. Feel like I'm about to die cause of the Prozac thats already in my system. Apparently you can't take both. FML
1	I have a life appointment tomorrow, and I'm going to cry to her about lamictal. Because it makes everything worse. I hate medication.
1	Fuckin wired! Not sleeping tonight. #Vyvanse #WhatDoIDo #Yuuuuup
1	@Derbyshirecc #carersweek Still no reply. Still cut off and isolated...on Duloxetine and sick but still forced to care...well done!
1	Sleeping my life away on #quetiapine. Fine by me.
1	"How do u do it? U got me losing every breath. What did u give me to make my heart beat out my chest?" #vyvanse
1	@jessielee122 You can say that again! I trusted my doc and ended up crippled thanks to just 12 Cipro pills. Going on 4 years now.
1	Quetiapine - I slept!! Weirdo dreams and very drowsy this morning but I slept!!!
1	@lynnbett Off Venlafaxine which was pure hell for me, I can't switch these meds anymore, tired of feeling like shit all day.
1	Did you know insanely intense dreams are a known side effect of venlafaxine? It's not an antidepressant, it's my Dream Fuel!
1	I am never taking baclofen and norflex the same day again. First I felt super drowsy but now I feel extremely high and it's freaking me out.
1	@lisabinkc @trainingwithra @dsymons Enbrel also available as prefilled syringe, much gentler. Pen leaves bruises! #rheum
1	@Zymymar stopped Zoloft cold turkey after I became suicidal, stopped Effexor because I was numb.
1	The #Quetiapine is kicking in. Bizarre thoughts tonight. Tempted to take the whole lot. I won't - don't worry people. Just odd thoughts.
1	@aDreamItsTrue things like mirtazipine&trazodone weight gain isn't too hard to mitigate.Things like valproate substantially more of an issue
1	I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY HUMIRA AT ALL THE PAIN IS ALWAYS UNBEARABLE AND I DON'T WANNA
1	@jessovenden No more SSRI’s for me. They kept giving me manic reactions, usually angry. The Seroquel has me feeling too tired. It’s brutal
1	Seriously if you are getting off cymbalta tape alot if movies I was up till 4 and feel and look like a zombie just to tired to growl !!!
1	Vyvanse is really taking its toll now #headache #anger
1	Brisdelle dangerous. Paxil is supposed to treat depression and suicidal thoughts. I took Paxil and got depressed. Went off & OK in 2 wk.
1	#tysabri really takes it out on me. Spent most of the day sleeping.
1	today is the day for my biweekly humira injection, any volunteers to take it for me? It hurts.
1	out of pills, feeling like a train wreck #tweaking #effexor
1	@Pete__Bull elderly, diabetic on olanzapine= raging bm's, mood swings and weight gain...cons may outweigh the pros..
1	I ate 2 cakes + 2 pastries at work today. Blaming the quetiapine rather than my liking for cakes. Blaming work too for providing free cake.
1	@HospitalPatient have been on Humira 2years now n get on off chest infections that sometimes need 2diff pills 2sort out should I b worried?
1	Depression hurts Cymbalta can... fuck your whole body up inside out so your rainy day doesn't seem so bad... pussy.
1	THIS PAXIL MAKES ME PEE SO OFTEN OMG #SorryNotSorry
1	06.30 day 14 Rivaroxaban diary. Thanks to paracetamol and hot water bottle I had 4 hrs continuous sleep. Woke uo with frontal headache, 1/2
1	I'm now back on the olanzapine along side lithium. Ugh. #helloweightgain
1	i have been on lorazepam / diazepam / quetiapine for the past few nights and i've noticed i am slightly drooling a bit. lovely.
1	The placebo week of birth control increases blood levels of Lamictal, which in turn makes me a very cheerful insomniac.
1	@HarryDFish @deltrimental Joe is on Pristiq and he gets weird brain zap / twitch things too.
1	He said he is 'slowly dying of starvation'. I don't want to be the one to say stop taking the Aricept and Namenda...
1	@ftamalenus I keep telling myself 8 am, but I think the Trazodone fucks it up. :( It knocks me right out and won't let me wake up.
1	@_RubyRouge_ I'm reducing duloxitine (been on 6 yr) and slowly increasing M but slept 13-14 hrs solid and still feel wasted
1	@mewtopia ...face. And quetiapine slightly increases sun sensitivity too.
1	this seroquel-dry-mouth thing is getting weird
1	@PreciousThing I just had a look buddy, and my medication (Seroquel) does affect tolerance to the sun.
1	@Back_datASHup same lol didn't eat a thing, damn vyvanse
1	Morning fluoxetine burp makes me want to ralph.
1	@TheMartinNewman to be honest I've had worse. On fluoxetine I was convinced there was a plot to steal my thoughts... !
1	Slept 11 hours last night on seroquel o.O
1	My medication is making me stupid, brain meds are not ok , fuck u paxil
1	@almostwell what problems did you have with humira, if you don't mind me asking. I tried infliximab it destroyed my liver.
1	@RipnerCabbit @pacerfox Ugh. My partner was on Paxil for a while. It made him hide in the apartment. :/
1	@MarkMcGahan80 does the Tysabri make you tired at first after infusion, not that you need an excuse to be tired! Sleep well xx :o) xx
1	Only problem is I'm hungry. Seroquel nation hunger :(
1	My mood swings are getting worse and lamotrigine isn't helping at all.…
1	I've been so tired since I started the Cymbalta. I sleep so much. Case in point: just slept an hour before bed.
1	Has anyone ever had to take Avelox? I need some tricks to curb the nausea and help me with the hypotension. #avelox #antibiotic #evil
1	I guess the Doctor was right when he said don't eat any dairy products within 2 hours of taking this Levofloxacin. #almostanaccident 3 times
1	@SonnieDetore I cannot be in the sun! #levaquin
1	@crohns_twins that sucks. Humira made me so sick. Remicade helped a but, but then seizures put that out. Now waiting, just prednisone now.
1	I've had no appetite since I started on Prozac, I guess that's a good thing
1	Note to self - nicotine lozenge & alcohol = nausea.
1	Act now and get our deluxe CYDE-FX set ABSOLUTELY FREE! Experience lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis like never before! #Quetiapine
1	I swear thia cymbalta is causing me to have horrible nightmares!
1	@wickychoo @LollyGee OMG ALL THE SPECIAL PLACES. I'm not drunk. It's the fluoxetine.
1	@Jonny_Wags @Hey_Jeffrey Realtalk: until I started taking Wellbutrin, Effexor robbed me of the ability to cum
1	@ZNB_Maqbool sweaty fluoxetine addict
1	I think baclofen might make me a bigger asshole than usual. :/
1	21.19 day 17 Rivaroxaban diary. Aches are related to pressure on my body, e.g. If sitting then in back, buttoocks and legs 1/2
1	Will still be on the Geodon, but will also be taking a low-dose alprazolam as needed for the sudden anxiety attacks ive been getting
1	@Basic_Chunnel @bromethazine I'm pretty lucid in all my dreams, and the Seroquel drowsiness carried over into the dream. LOLOL.
1	05.00 day 17 Rivaroxaban diary. Woken up by pain in neck, hips and legs.
1	FOUND THEM. Starting back up on Effexor. Vomits shall ensue!
1	@amanda_stand @mycuriousmind wow. Venlafaxine and mirtazapine must be very sedative. I’ve had them before separately n was knocked out-ishX
1	@ItsMeCreezy I hate to hear that. Taking seroquel is like swallowing a sleeping pill when u wake up then trying to function normally
1	I've been getting almost daily headaches for the past 3 weeks side effects of #enbrel ? I've been on it for months now though #rheum
1	02.03 Rivaroxaban diary day 20. Some neck pain and legs still weak, but feeling much better. Very warm night.
1	@LithiumLibGirl I can relate to the olanzapine lbs, but you'll be great!
1	@Glass1ncision It's called Seroquel Prolong (Quetiapine). Apart from the weight gain, I am actually quite happy with it.
1	@raCanuck I had a weird rash w/ Enbrel. But it was all over my abdomen & chest. Rash in elbow cld b psoriasis? Can u take a pic?
1	I don't know whether my Vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my Vyvanse addiction.
1	#EDS friends! Anybody taken #Cipro? (antibiotic) Complications?? Big side effect is tendon rupture...figured my dr would know better?
1	Question: recently I have been hyper-sensitive to different textures, does anyone know if this is a bipolar / lamotrigine thing??
1	Nicotine withdrawals #2DaysDown #ForeverToGo #headache #irritable #toomanyhashtags #makeitstop
1	@tomd5000 god tell me about it I was a methotrexate and Humira they have me horrid side effects...I feel horrid today tho
1	@doctorchristian I take olanzapine and have a permanent dry mouth what can I do to help it
1	@southkirk @PositiveAboutMS Thinking it might be the baclofen doing it.Only on a low dose though.Broken sleep is a nightmare.#MSFatigue
1	its your third visit in 2 weeks for priapism and you're still taking trazodone @ERProblem
1	04.46 day 23 rivaroxaban diary. Much better than yesterday. Still neck, back, hip, and leg aches but not so intense.
1	Vyvanse and seroquel #TwoThingsThatDontMixWell
1	@pseudodeviant i clock in at 16 stone (added 1 stone since quetiapine) and according to that BMI thing I'm obese, which I'm clearly not.
1	@SDunn242 yup quetiapine. The normal dose at night whacks me out. I'd have been asleep til Friday on double
1	Effexor side effects; headaches, no appetite.
1	Got offered a seat on the tube this morning. Quetiapine, like pregnancy, but hungrier. #bipolarlifestylechoice
1	I think this Olanzapine makes me crazier.
1	What! Nightmare made me jump awake! Not nice at all. Thought #quetiapine was supposed to keep me asleep through the night #psychosis #fail
1	one of the things i hate most about quetiapine is when i take it for the first few hours i slur my words, so people assume i'm merely drunk.
1	@itwasntbay yeah when I take vyvanse any food just looks/sounds/tastes fucking disgusting
1	I shouldn't tweet on vyvanse it's going to be extremely negative lol
1	My medication gives me weird & bizarre dreams. Not all bad though. Last night I had dinner with the Rolling Stones #ciprolex
1	I seem to need to sleep right now. Quetiapine takers, is this normal?
1	okay i took the seroquel and i am resisting the urge to vomit it up i feel disgusting but oH WELL GOOD TIMES GOOD VIBES DON'T BE SAD
1	@OUCH_UK didnt know Lamotrigine was addictive Stopped as didnt think were helping @clusterheads 3 days of hell before realized, back on now
1	Playing league while on vyvanse is too damn stressful. Back to public I go!
1	@_cimmy_ thanks! yes, after I was prescribed Cipro a few years ago, and it REALLY messed me up, I am quite wary of broad spectrum ones.
1	Restless Leg Syndrome is bad tonight. Damn you fluoxetine.
1	@whatkatie_did I'm certainly weird but it's quetiapine instead of crack, I can't get that on prescription.
1	Gotta find an alternative to Vyvanse, ASAP. I'd rather be sleepy & happy, than alert & depressed!
1	Day 4: The initial lamotrigine lethargy kicked in the day before exams. I tell myself that possible failure is better than possible death.
1	Have any of you developed knee pain since starting Tysabri ? What helps with the problem ?
1	Am I the only one that grinds the shit out of their teeth on vyvanse? #cantbetheonlyone #icouldstudyforfinalsidonthave
1	Medication side-affects have hit me hard today: I keep on randomly jolting or rocking, it is so bad I am finding it hard to type! #Seroquel
1	A big ol' fuck you to my doctor for not telling me a side effect of metoprolol was depression. Just wait until I see you Friday -.-
1	Does anyone on #tysabri get flu Iike symptoms, aches and pains, shivers a sweats I seem to get it about a week or so after I've had infusion
1	Extra Quetiapine and two Zopiclone still aren't helping me sleep. Head full of broken biscuits at 4am with horrid intrusive thoughts
1	@WarWraith I'm not even sure what to request. :/ Sertraline makes me sick now, Venlafaxine made me sick, Reboxetine and Citalopram useless
1	@TweetNomDePlume SSRIs were great for me for ages, not working as well now. Thus Seroquel. I’m also on Clonazepam, makes me sleepy too.
1	@thebeecharmer97 @wyrdotter @danadelany psssh didn't Levaquin make u hallucinate? Girl u best stay Away from shrooms lol
1	@MTV When are you going to do True Life: I am addicted to Vyvanse?
1	@GSXR1KBUSAKILLA but I switched to trazodone ... I was doing some crazy ish on Ambien smh not good lol
1	waitt..Here it comes..The #seroquel is pulling me under..Also I now have the sudden urge to procure food.. #fmlimugly
1	@FriarDanny I appreciate it. I gained over 30lbs with Paxil so I'm trying something different, tired of the appetite side effects.
1	Ah the sting of the #Humira injection. How I've not missed thee. #Ankylosing #Spondylitisq #Ouch
1	@Sectioned_ @bipolarlife7 @BBCWomansHour ah yes, I'm starting to think my paroxetine turns panic attacks into fat.
1	This higher dose of #cymbalta is making me extremely tired and anxious. Is this normal?
